What is the function of the `.divider` class within a Bootstrap dropdown menu?
It divides the dropdown into multiple columns.
It disables the link that it is applied to.
It is used to separate links with a thin horizontal line.
It creates a header for a group of links.

✅ **Correct answer:**
**It is used to separate links with a thin horizontal line.**

**Explanation:**
In **Bootstrap**, the `.divider` class (or in Bootstrap 4/5, **`dropdown-divider`**) is applied inside a dropdown menu to create a **thin horizontal line** that visually separates groups of menu items.

Example:

```html
<div class="dropdown-menu">
  <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action 1</a>
  <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
  <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action 2</a>
</div>
```

This improves readability by grouping related items.
