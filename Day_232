## 🕰️ What Is an “Antique Style” PPT?

This doesn’t mean old and dusty — it means:

* Visuals and fonts that reflect the era (like 70s, 80s, 90s)
* Slide designs that feel like they were made using typewriters, overhead projectors, or early PowerPoint
* Color palettes from vintage documents, retro posters, or early science textbooks

| 🎨 Color Palette  | Sepia, muted yellow, off-white, olive green, deep red, dull blue        |
| 📜 Backgrounds    | Paper texture, blueprint style, graph paper, chalkboard                 |
| ✍️ Fonts          | Typewriter font (Courier), retro serif (Georgia), or 90s tech (OCR A)   |
| 📎 Icons/Graphics | Hand-drawn diagrams, old lab notes, newspaper cutout look               |
| 📽️ Animation     | Minimal. No slick transitions. Stick to fades or typewriter text reveal |

## 🪄 Gamma Prompt: Make a Vintage-Style Story Presentation

Here’s a Gamma AI prompt to generate a presentation with an antique/lab-report feel:

---

### 📜 Vintage Gamma Prompt

```
Create a 10-slide presentation in a retro, antique, or vintage academic style — as if it were created between 1965 and 1995 by a scientist or historian documenting the invention of the blue LED.

Title: “The Impossible Light: A Declassified Report on the Blue LED Discovery (1965–1993)”

Style & Theme Instructions:
– Background: Textured paper, manila file folders, blueprint paper, or chalkboard feel
– Fonts: Use typewriter-style (Courier), old serif fonts (Georgia), or OCR-style fonts from early computers
– Colors: Use sepia, olive green, vintage red, faded blue, or aged yellow
– Add subtle effects: faded edges, grain, old photo overlays
– Icons/images should look archival or diagrammatic (not modern or glossy)
– Animations: Use slow fades or a typewriter text effect only (if available)

Slide Flow (Storytelling Format):

1. Cover Page: Title, subtitle, authors, and a vintage image of a lab or LED
2. Introduction: “A Missing Color” – red and green existed, but blue was the unsolved puzzle
3. The Early Days: Timeline of red/green LED development & the 1972 RCA blue LED attempt
4. The Scientific Wall: Why gallium nitride (GaN) was hard to work with; failed doping attempts
5. Meet the Pioneers: Akasaki, Amano, Nakamura – with black-and-white images and lab notes
6. The Breakthrough: How buffer layers and new growth techniques cracked the problem
7. Blueprint of a Blue LED: Diagram of layer structure (like an old patent sheet)
8. The World Reacts: 2014 Nobel Prize and global lighting revolution
9. Fun Fact Section: Early prototypes, quotes from old papers, tech trivia
10. Final Slide: "Archived and Acknowledged" – final thoughts + Q&A

Make the entire deck feel like it’s from a declassified archive or vintage science museum exhibit. Think Cold War lab reports + early PowerPoint 1.0 vibes.

Add placeholder images and suggest retro icons or visuals (like CRT monitors, old LED watches, patent sketches).

## 💡 Bonus Tips to Enhance Vintage Feel

* Use scanned handwritten notes or doodles on slides
* Add “CONFIDENTIAL” or “LAB USE ONLY” stamps for fun
* Show “Slide projector” shadows or frames
* Use only 4:3 aspect ratio (not wide screen — for that 90s look)
