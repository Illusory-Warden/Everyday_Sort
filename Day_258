Your screenshots show that while the Twingate connector Docker containers are running and healthy, the Twingate admin console still marks all connectors as "Could not connect" or "Not yet connected."

This usually happens because when your Raspberry Pi was powered off for 3 days:

1. **The connector’s network path to Twingate servers is blocked or disrupted**

   * If your Pi’s IP changed (especially in a DHCP network) or your firewall/router settings changed, the container might not be able to reach Twingate servers.

2. **DNS or outbound connection issues**

   * If DNS resolution or outbound TCP/UDP ports needed by Twingate (e.g., 443, sometimes 3478 for STUN) are blocked, the connector can’t register as online.

3. **Authentication tokens expired**

   * If the connector tokens were invalidated (e.g., due to being inactive or reset from the admin panel), the containers will run but fail to authenticate with Twingate.

4. **Multiple connectors from same device without proper configuration**

   * You have **three running connectors** on the same Pi. If all are trying to register with Twingate using the same outbound IP and possibly conflicting configs, only the correctly authenticated one should work — but if none are properly registered, all will appear offline.

**What you should do:**

1. Check logs of one connector to see the actual error:

   ```bash
   sudo docker logs <container_id>
   ```

   Replace `<container_id>` with one from `docker ps` (e.g., `22d4`).

2. Ensure your Pi has outbound internet and can resolve DNS:

   ```bash
   ping google.com
   curl https://twingate.com
   ```

3. Confirm that the connector tokens in your Docker `run` command or `docker-compose.yml` are still valid.
   If not, **redeploy with a fresh token** from the Twingate admin panel.

4. If these connectors are duplicates or stale, **stop and remove all containers** and redeploy only the ones you actually need:

   ```bash
   sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -aq --filter ancestor=twingate/connector:1)
   ```

   Then deploy **a single connector** per site, using a fresh token.
