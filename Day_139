>
> 1. **Title Slide**
>
>    * Title: “Gains and Losses in Behavioral Economics”
>    * Subtitle: Internal Assessment Presentation
>    * Presented by: \[Your Name] & \[Partner's Name]
>    * Image suggestion: Abstract economics-themed background or simple scale showing gain/loss
> 2. **Introduction to Behavioral Economics**
>
>    * Define behavioral economics
>    * Explain how it differs from classical economics
>    * Add a relevant image (e.g., cartoon or icon of “rational vs. irrational decision-making”)
> 3. **Understanding Gains and Losses**
>
>    * Define “gains” and “losses” in decision-making
>    * Introduce concept of **reference points** (how people compare to a baseline)
>    * Visual: Graph of utility from gains and losses or simple seesaw image
> 4. **Loss Aversion**
>
>    * Explain loss aversion: People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains
>    * Include a famous quote from Kahneman or Tversky
>    * Visual: Simple chart showing the steeper loss curve
> 5. **Prospect Theory Overview**
>
>    * Brief intro to Prospect Theory by Kahneman & Tversky
>    * Explain how it models decision-making under risk
>    * Visual: Standard Prospect Theory value function graph
> 6. **Framing Effects**
>
>    * Show how the same information framed as gain/loss changes choices
>    * Example: Disease problem (200 lives saved vs. 400 will die)
>    * Visual: Side-by-side comparison or infographic
> 7. **Real-Life Applications: Marketing**
>
>    * Show how companies use gain/loss framing in pricing and advertising
>    * Example: “You save ₹200” vs. “Don’t miss out on ₹200 savings”
>    * Visual: Screenshot of actual ad examples or before-after pricing tags
> 8. **Real-Life Applications: Public Policy**
>
>    * How governments use gain/loss framing to influence behavior
>    * Example: Tax penalties vs. Tax discounts
>    * Visual: Picture of tax form or penalty notice
> 9. **Case Study Slide**
>
>    * Choose ONE real-world example of gain/loss framing used effectively (e.g., energy conservation, insurance plans, retirement savings)
>    * Explain the behavioral insight and outcome
>    * Visual: Graph or news image related to the example
> 10. **Criticism and Limitations**
>
>     * Critiques of framing and loss aversion (e.g., cultural/context dependence)
>     * Mention possible ethical concerns in nudging behavior
>     * Visual: Icon or cartoon of “mind control” or manipulation warning
> 11. **Conclusion Slide**
>
>     * Recap key takeaways: Loss aversion, framing, and their influence
>     * Why understanding this is important for future economists or marketers
>     * Visual: Positive closing image (e.g., a brain with lightbulb)
> 12. **Q\&A Slide**
>
>     * Text: “Questions & Answers”
>     * Visual: Thought bubble or question mark icons
