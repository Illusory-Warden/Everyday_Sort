**Rational 200 mg** typically contains **ofloxacin**, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, including some types of diarrhea (like bacterial gastroenteritis). However, **not all cases of stomach pain and loose motion require antibiotics** — and using antibiotics unnecessarily can do more harm than good.

### Before taking Rational 200 mg, consider the following:

#### ✅ It **may be appropriate** if:

* You have **bacterial diarrhea** (e.g., traveler’s diarrhea, food poisoning from bacteria).
* You have **high fever**, blood in stool, or severe symptoms.
* A doctor has previously prescribed it for similar symptoms in you.

#### ❌ Do **not** take it if:

* Your symptoms are **mild** and likely due to a **viral infection** or **indigestion** (antibiotics won't help).
* You’ve had **no medical evaluation** — overusing antibiotics can cause side effects like antibiotic resistance or worsening gut flora.
* You have a **sulfa allergy** or other drug sensitivities (check the leaflet).

### Recommended First Steps:

1. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of fluids (ORS, coconut water, clear soups).
2. **Avoid spicy or oily food**.
3. Consider taking a **probiotic** to support gut health.
4. If loose motion persists beyond 1–2 days or worsens (with fever, blood in stool, or dehydration), **see a doctor** for evaluation.

### In Summary:

* If your symptoms are **mild** and you’re not feeling very unwell, it's better to **wait and hydrate**.
* Only take **Rational 200 mg** if it has been prescribed for you or you’re sure it’s a **bacterial** cause.
* **Consult a doctor** if you're unsure — it's the safest course.
