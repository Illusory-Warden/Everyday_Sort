### 🎯 My assessment: Is this a “top-level” IEEE conference?

Here’s a breakdown of what to look at and how this one stacks up:

**What supports credibility:**

* It is technically *co-sponsored* by a local IEEE Section: IEEE Madhya Pradesh Section. ([oriental.ac.in][1])
* It has a posted IEEE Record Number (#67170), which means it is listed as a conference in the IEEE database. ([oriental.ac.in][1])
* The website states that accepted & presented papers will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore, which is a positive sign. ([oriental.ac.in][2])
* Very broad track coverage — good if your paper falls into one of their listed areas.

**What raises caution / things to check:**

* Even though they say “will only be submitted to IEEE Xplore”, note the phrase *“subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements”*. That means submission ≠ guaranteed inclusion.
* Because it is a **first edition** (“1st International Conference on …”) according to their page. ([oriental.ac.in][1]) First-time conferences can vary widely in reputation, review rigour, and visibility.
* Being regionally organised (in Bhopal) and by an institute rather than a long-standing flagship IEEE conference means the “prestige” may not be comparable to major long-running IEEE flagship conferences (e.g., those invited by large IEEE societies).
* For “top-level” in academia you often check factors like: long history, high impact, rigorous acceptance rate, strong global programme committee, whether proceedings have been reliably indexed in IEEE Xplore for past years, whether the conference is listed in major rankings (e.g., CORE, Scopus, etc). I did *not* find independent evidence of past editions with large citations or verifying indexing reliably yet.

**My conclusion:**
Yes, it *is* a legitimate IEEE-recorded conference with IEEE co-sponsorship and the mechanism for publication in IEEE Xplore. That means it is **reasonably credible**, especially if you are a student or researcher wanting a peer-reviewed venue.
However — if by “top-level” you mean the most selective, highly-cited flagship conferences in your field (with brand-name recognition, very low acceptance rates, perhaps invited keynotes, etc) — then this one might **not** yet rank at that top tier. It’s more of a good regional/international conference rather than a global “top 10 in the world” venue.

### 🔍 My recommendation for you (as a student)

Since you (as a student) want to submit a paper, here are some practical steps & things to check:

* Ensure your paper fits clearly into one of their tracks and aligns with the theme.
* Make sure you’ll meet the deadlines (submission 8 Nov 2025) and registration/presentation requirements.
* Check **whether past editions** (if any) have actually resulted in IEEE Xplore‐indexed proceedings — you may ask the organisers to provide sample proceedings or check the IEEE Xplore database for “IC-DECoN 2024 / 2023” if they exist.
* Confirm costs (registration fee, travel if you attend offline) and whether you will present offline or online. Since offline presentations get “extra credit” according to their criteria. ([oriental.ac.in][1])
* Confirm your institution/supervisor is okay with this conference in terms of their expectations (for your CV, publication record etc).
* If you aim for the highest prestige (for example for PhD admissions, strong journal submission, or very selective publication) you might also **compare** this conference with other IEEE conferences in your domain and see which one aligns better.
