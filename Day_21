What is a case study ?

A case study is an in-depth analysis of a specific subject, such as an individual, group, organization, event, or phenomenon. It is commonly used in fields like business, medicine, psychology, and social sciences to explore real-world situations, identify patterns, and derive insights.

Case studies typically involve:

Background Information: Context about the subject.

Problem or Objective: The issue being analyzed.

Methodology: How data was collected and analyzed.

Findings: Observations and results.

Conclusion & Recommendations: Lessons learned and possible solutions.

They can be descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory, depending on the research goal. Case studies help in practical learning and decision-making by examining real-life scenarios.


project management strategies and models.
Project management strategies and models help teams plan, execute, and complete projects efficiently. Here are some key ones:

1. Traditional (Waterfall Model) – A linear, step-by-step approach where each phase (planning, execution, testing, etc.) must be completed before moving to the next. Best for well-defined projects with clear requirements.

2. Agile Methodology – A flexible, iterative approach that breaks projects into smaller cycles called sprints. It allows continuous feedback and adaptation. Common in software development.

3. Scrum – A type of Agile framework that organizes work into short, focused sprints (usually two weeks) with daily stand-up meetings and clear roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner.

4. Kanban – A visual workflow method that uses boards (physical or digital) to track tasks in different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done). Helps in managing work efficiently without overwhelming the team.

5. Lean Project Management – Focuses on reducing waste, maximizing value, and improving efficiency. Originated from Toyota’s manufacturing processes but is now widely used in various industries.

6. Six Sigma – A data-driven approach aimed at improving processes by reducing defects and variations. It follows structured methodologies like DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).

7. PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments) – A structured project management method that defines clear roles, responsibilities, and stages. Popular in government and large organizations.

8. Critical Path Method (CPM) – A technique for identifying the longest sequence of dependent tasks in a project, helping to determine the shortest possible completion time.

9. Hybrid Models – Many organizations mix different approaches, like combining Agile and Waterfall, to fit their unique project needs.
