An **SSL certificate** (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection. It's a critical part of **internet security**, ensuring that data passed between web servers and browsers remains **private and integral**.

### 🔐 What Does SSL Do?

1. **Encrypts Data**  
   SSL uses encryption protocols (TLS is the modern successor to SSL, but the term "SSL" is still widely used) to scramble data during transmission. This prevents third parties from intercepting sensitive information like:
   - Credit card numbers  
   - Login credentials  
   - Personal details  

2. **Authenticates Identity**  
   It verifies that the website the user is connecting to is legitimate and not an imposter (e.g., phishing websites). This is done through a **trusted Certificate Authority (CA)** that issues the certificate after verification.

3. **Establishes Trust**  
   When a site has an SSL certificate:
   - A padlock icon appears in the browser's address bar.
   - The website uses `https://` instead of `http://`.
   - Visitors are more likely to trust and interact with it.

### 📜 How It Works (Technically)

1. **Handshake Process**  
   When a user connects to a secure website:
   - The browser requests the server’s SSL certificate.
   - The server sends its certificate and public key.
   - The browser checks that the certificate is valid and signed by a trusted CA.
   - If verified, the browser and server agree on a **session key**.
   - This key is used to encrypt data during the session.

2. **Public and Private Keys**  
   SSL uses **asymmetric encryption** initially (public/private keys) and then switches to **symmetric encryption** (faster) for the session.

### 🏷️ Types of SSL Certificates

1. **DV (Domain Validated)**  
   - Basic level of security  
   - Confirms domain ownership only  
   - Issued quickly (minutes to hours)

2. **OV (Organization Validated)**  
   - Verifies domain ownership and organization info  
   - More trusted than DV  
   - Takes a few days to issue

3. **EV (Extended Validation)**  
   - Most rigorous validation  
   - Displays the organization's name in the address bar  
   - Used by major financial or e-commerce sites

4. **Wildcard SSL**  
   - Secures a domain and all its subdomains  
   - Example: `*.yourdomain.com`

5. **Multi-Domain (SAN) SSL**  
   - Secures multiple domains with one certificate

### 🏦 Certificate Authorities (CAs)

These are trusted third-party organizations that issue SSL certificates. Popular CAs include:
- **DigiCert**
- **Sectigo (formerly Comodo)**
- **Let’s Encrypt** (free, automated, open CA)
- **GoDaddy**
- **GlobalSign**

---

### 📅 Validity and Renewal

- SSL certificates are valid for **1–2 years**, after which they must be renewed.
- Some platforms (like Let’s Encrypt) offer certificates that renew every **90 days**.

### 🔍 Why SSL Is Important Today

- **Google Ranking**: Google uses HTTPS as a ranking factor.
- **Browser Warnings**: Modern browsers mark non-HTTPS sites as “Not Secure”.
- **GDPR/Compliance**: For legal and regulatory compliance regarding user data.
