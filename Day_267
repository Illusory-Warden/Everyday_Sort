Yes, the **Rajmargyatra** app available on the Play Store (and iOS App Store) is **completely legal**—it’s developed and officially maintained by the **National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)**. It's designed as a citizen-centric tool to enhance highway-related services and travel convenience. ([Google Play][1], [Press Information Bureau][2])

**Here’s the proof of its legitimacy:**

* The app description clearly states it’s an official NHAI product. It offers features like information on toll plazas, nearby services (petrol pumps, hospitals, hotels), complaint redressal with geo-tagged media, journey recording, speed alerts, FASTag integrations, and voice assistance. ([Google Play][1])

* NHAI publicly announced its launch via several official channels including the Press Information Bureau. For example, a press release dated February 6, 2025, confirms the app’s purpose and features, and highlights its widespread adoption—over 348,000 downloads on Google Play and 74,000 on the App Store, along with a strong 4.4-star rating.

Given these official sources, the app is legitimate, safe to download, and legally sanctioned by the Indian government to serve highway users.
