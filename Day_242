To access your Raspberry Pi's local files from Parrot OS, you have several options. Here's the best approach:

## Method 1: SSH/SFTP (Recommended - Most Secure)

### **Using Terminal (SSH):**
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.100.100
```
- Replace `pi` with your actual RPI username
- Enter your password when prompted
- Now you can navigate and manage files using terminal commands

### **Using Gigolo for SFTP:**
1. Open Gigolo
2. Create new bookmark:
   - **Service type:** SSH
   - **Server:** 192.168.100.100
   - **Port:** 22
   - **User Name:** pi (or your RPI username)
   - **Folder:** / (to access root, or specify a path like /home/pi)
3. Click "Add" and connect

### **Using File Manager (Nautilus/Thunar):**
1. Open your file manager
2. Go to "Other Locations" or "Network"
3. In the address bar, type: `sftp://192.168.100.100`
4. Enter your RPI credentials

## Method 2: SMB/CIFS Shares

### **Enable SMB on your RPI first:**
```bash
# SSH into your RPI and install Samba
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin

# Configure a share
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add this to the end of the file:
```
[RPIFiles]
path = /home/pi
browseable = yes
writeable = yes
only guest = no
create mask = 0777
directory mask = 0777
public = no
```

### **Set Samba password:**
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
```

### **Connect from Parrot OS:**
- **Via Gigolo:** Service type "Windows share", Server: 192.168.100.100
- **Via File Manager:** `smb://192.168.100.100`

## Method 3: SCP for File Transfer

### **Copy files from RPI to Parrot OS:**
```bash
scp pi@192.168.100.100:/path/to/file /local/destination/
```

### **Copy files from Parrot OS to RPI:**
```bash
scp /local/file pi@192.168.100.100:/remote/destination/
```

## Prerequisites Check:

### **On your RPI, ensure SSH is enabled:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### **Check if SSH is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

## Quick Test:

Test connectivity first:
```bash
ping 192.168.100.100
```

Then test SSH:
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.100.100
```

## For Full File System Access:

If you want to browse the entire RPI file system:
- Use SSH/SFTP method
- Set folder path to `/` in Gigolo
- This gives you access to all directories: `/home/`, `/var/`, `/etc/`, etc.

The **SSH/SFTP method** is the most straightforward since SSH is usually enabled by default on most RPI installations. This will give you full access to your RPI's file system through a secure connection.
