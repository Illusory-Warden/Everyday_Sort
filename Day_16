### **ARPwatch: Overview and Features**  

**ARPwatch** is a network monitoring tool that tracks **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** traffic on a network. It is primarily used for **detecting ARP spoofing, monitoring MAC-IP pair changes, and alerting network administrators about suspicious activities**.

### **Key Features of ARPwatch**  

âœ… **Monitors ARP Traffic** â€“ Tracks ARP requests and responses in real time.  
âœ… **Detects ARP Spoofing & Poisoning** â€“ Alerts when an IP address suddenly resolves to a different MAC address.  
âœ… **Logs MAC-IP Address Mappings** â€“ Keeps a database of known MAC-to-IP associations.  
âœ… **Sends Alerts via Email** â€“ Notifies administrators when an anomaly is detected.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Efficient** â€“ Runs with minimal system resources.  
âœ… **Useful for Network Security** â€“ Helps prevent **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks**.

### **How ARPwatch Works**  

1. **Listens to Network Traffic**  
   - ARPwatch continuously captures ARP packets on the network interface.  
   
2. **Records MAC-IP Pairs**  
   - It maintains a database of known MAC addresses and their corresponding IP addresses.  

3. **Detects Changes**  
   - If a MAC address is reassigned to a different IP or vice versa, it logs the event.  

4. **Generates Alerts**  
   - Sends alerts to the system logs or via email when it detects unusual behavior.

### **Installing and Running ARPwatch**  

#### **Install ARPwatch**  
On Debian-based systems (like **Parrot OS, Ubuntu, Kali Linux**):  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install arpwatch
```
On Arch-based systems:  
```bash
sudo pacman -S arpwatch
```

#### **Start ARPwatch**  
```bash
sudo arpwatch -i eth0
```
*(Replace `eth0` with the appropriate network interface, e.g., `wlan0` for Wi-Fi.)*  

#### **View Logs**  
ARPwatch logs are stored in:  
```bash
/var/log/syslog
```
To view recent logs:  
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep arpwatch
```

#### **Enable Automatic Startup**  
To run ARPwatch on system boot:  
```bash
sudo systemctl enable arpwatch
sudo systemctl start arpwatch
```

### **Use Cases of ARPwatch**  

ðŸ”¹ **Detecting ARP Spoofing & Poisoning Attacks** â€“ Protects against **MITM attacks** where an attacker manipulates ARP tables to intercept network traffic.  
ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring Network Devices** â€“ Keeps track of new and removed devices in a network.  
ðŸ”¹ **Tracking MAC Address Changes** â€“ Useful in large networks where unauthorized devices might connect.  
ðŸ”¹ **Security Auditing** â€“ Helps network admins detect suspicious activities.
