**Example:** Opening a Clothing Boutique

1. **Planning**

   * First, I will decide the main objective of the boutique, which is to provide **trendy, good-quality, and affordable clothing** to customers.
   * I will choose the type of clothes to sell such as **casual wear, ethnic wear, and accessories** for men and women.
   * I will fix prices suitable for middle-income customers and fashion-conscious youth.
   * A **prime location** in a shopping street or near a college will be selected.
   * I will also prepare a **budget**, find reliable **clothing suppliers**, and set **sales targets** (for example, at least 100 customers daily).

2. **Organizing**

   * After planning, I will organize the structure of the boutique: **Owner → Manager → Sales Executives → Cashier → Helpers**.
   * Responsibilities will be divided clearly — sales executives will assist customers, the cashier will handle billing, and the manager will oversee stock and suppliers.
   * I will also arrange **resources** such as display racks, trial rooms, billing counters, mannequins, and storage areas to ensure smooth operations.

3. **Staffing**

   * In this step, I will hire the right people — **salespersons with good communication and fashion sense**, a **cashier** with basic accounting knowledge, and **helpers** for stock management.
   * I will provide **training** to the staff on customer service, product knowledge, and billing procedures.
   * The staff strength will be maintained according to the boutique’s size and workload so that no one is overworked or idle.

4. **Directing / Coordinating**

   * I will **guide and motivate** my employees to provide the best customer experience.
   * Incentives such as **sales commissions, appreciation, or bonuses** will be given for good performance.
   * Clear instructions will be given — for example, **keep the boutique clean**, **greet customers politely**, and **maintain display arrangements**.
   * Coordination between the sales team and the manager will be ensured so that customer needs are quickly fulfilled and stocks are replenished on time.

5. **Controlling**

   * Finally, I will maintain control over the boutique’s performance by setting standards like **high customer satisfaction, low stock wastage, and good sales figures**.
   * I will regularly **compare actual results** with these standards.
   * If sales are low or customers complain, I will take **corrective actions** such as changing display designs, adding new collections, or giving festive discounts.
   * Continuous monitoring will ensure that the boutique **grows successfully and maintains its reputation**.

This activity explains how the **functions of management** — *Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing, and Controlling* — are applied in the **real-life example of opening and managing a clothing boutique**.
