### 🕓 Why It Might Still Be in “Scrutiny”

1. **Backlog at the Copyright Office:**
   The Copyright Office in Delhi often has a high volume of applications, so scrutiny can take several months beyond the usual 1–2 months.

2. **Internal verification delays:**
   Sometimes the examiner hasn’t yet opened your file for review, especially if multiple applicants (like your group project) are listed.

3. **Discrepancy letter pending upload:**
   Occasionally, a discrepancy notice is issued but not yet visible on the portal — it appears under *Status Remarks* once uploaded.

4. **Technical or administrative hold:**
   If any uploaded document (like NOC, declaration, or manuscript) was unreadable, it can stall the review until clarified.
