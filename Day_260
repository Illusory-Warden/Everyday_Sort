ERROR: TCP port forwarding appears to be disabled on the remote host. 
Ensure that the sshd_config has `AllowTcpForwarding yes`. 
channel 3: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
```

This means the VS Code Remote-SSH server cannot set up the necessary tunnel because **TCP port forwarding is disabled on your Raspberry Pi (`warden`)**. VS Code Remote-SSH relies on this to communicate with the remote server.

---

### How to fix it:

1. **SSH into your Pi manually**

```bash
ssh pi@192.168.100.100
```

2. **Edit the SSH server configuration**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

3. **Find and set the following options**
   Make sure these lines exist and are set as follows:

```text
AllowTcpForwarding yes
PermitTunnel yes
```

4. **Restart the SSH server**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

5. **Try connecting again from VS Code**

ðŸ’¡ **Extra tip:**
After changing these settings, VS Code should be able to connect normally. If you still see errors, you can also check if `GatewayPorts` is needed (set `GatewayPorts yes`) depending on your network setup.
