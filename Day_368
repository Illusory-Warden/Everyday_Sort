Hereâ€™s how you can structure your **AI-centered literature search prompts**:

---

## ðŸ”¹ AI-Oriented Literature Survey Prompts

### **General**

* *"Convolutional neural networks for medical image classification deep learning applications brain tumor lung cancer skin cancer"*
* *"Comparative study of CNN architectures (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, Inception) for cancer image classification"*
* *"Transfer learning with CNN models in medical image datasets brain tumor lung cancer skin cancer"*

---

### **Dataset Specific**

1. **Brain Tumor (MRI images)**

   * *"Brain tumor detection using deep learning CNN architectures MRI image classification"*
   * *"Transfer learning CNN models (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) for brain tumor classification"*

2. **Lung Cancer (CT images)**

   * *"Deep learning CNN for lung cancer detection and classification CT images"*
   * *"Comparative CNN approaches for lung cancer diagnosis using transfer learning"*

3. **Skin Cancer (Dermoscopic images â€“ HAM10000, ISIC dataset)**

   * *"Skin cancer classification CNN deep learning dermoscopy images HAM10000 ISIC dataset"*
   * *"AI-based transfer learning for melanoma and skin lesion detection using CNNs"*

---

### **Comparative AI Research (Strong Fit for Your Paper)**

* *"Comparative performance of deep learning CNN models in multi-cancer image classification"*
* *"Survey of convolutional neural networks in medical image analysis with focus on brain tumor, lung cancer, and skin cancer"*
* *"Evaluation of CNN architectures for cancer image detection transfer learning and accuracy comparison"*

---

## ðŸ”¹ Best AI-Centric Sources to Target

* **Google Scholar** â†’ quick access to AI + CNN papers.
* **IEEE Xplore** â†’ strong for CNN architecture papers applied to medical imaging.
* **Springer (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Medical Image Computing)** â†’ AI-focused.
* **ScienceDirect / Elsevier** â†’ often publishes applied AI in healthcare.
* **Papers With Code ([https://paperswithcode.com/](https://paperswithcode.com/))** â†’ find CNN papers **with code + datasets**.

âœ… **Tip for Writing the AI Literature Survey Section**

* Begin with **overview of CNN in medical imaging** (how AI has improved diagnosis).
* Then cover **dataset-wise applications**:

  * Brain Tumor â†’ MRI, CNN & Transfer Learning models.
  * Lung Cancer â†’ CT imaging, CNN-based CAD systems.
  * Skin Cancer â†’ Dermoscopic image datasets like ISIC, HAM10000.
* Finally, move into **comparative works** where authors tested multiple CNN architectures.
* Highlight gaps (e.g., lack of cross-dataset comparison) â†’ this becomes your **research justification**.
