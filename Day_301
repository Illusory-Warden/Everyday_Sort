### ðŸ”¹ The Rule

For **tight bound (Î˜)**, you need **any** two positive constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ (with $c_1 < c_2$) such that:

$$
c_1 n \;\le\; f(n) \;\le\; c_2 n \quad \text{for all } n \ge n_0
$$

Thereâ€™s no requirement that you *must* use 2 and 3.
We picked 2 and 3 because they are the simplest values around the coefficient of the leading term (2).

---

### ðŸ”¹ If 2 and 3 donâ€™t workâ€¦

You can **try larger constants**, like 4 and 5, or even 10 and 20.
As long as the inequality holds **eventually** (for some $n_0$), the proof is valid.

For example:

Check with $c_2 = 5$:

$$
2n+5 \le 5n \quad \iff \quad 5 \le 3n
$$

This is true for all $n \ge 2$. âœ…

So it still works.

---

### ðŸ”¹ The key idea

* $c_1$ should be **â‰¤ leading coefficient** (so the lower inequality holds).
* $c_2$ should be **â‰¥ leading coefficient** (so the upper inequality holds).
* If first guess fails for small $n$, just **increase $n_0$** or pick slightly bigger constants.

âœ… So yes, if 2 and 3 donâ€™t work, you can take 4 and 5 (or any other pair), and the bound will still be correct.
