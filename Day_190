### âœ… Here's What You Need to Confirm

1. **Check your Raspberry Pi's IP** (where n8n is running):

   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

   Let's say it's: `192.168.1.42`

2. **Check where your Twingate Connector is running**:

   * If it's running on a **server, PC, or NAS** in the same network as your Raspberry Pi (e.g., also on `192.168.1.x`), you're good.

3. **Ping test (optional)** from the Connector host:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.42
   ```

   Or from the Connector container using:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <connector_container_name> ping 192.168.1.42
   ```

### ðŸ”§ What to Do Next

1. **In your Twingate Admin Console**, add a new **Resource**:

   * Name: `n8n`
   * Address: `192.168.1.42`
   * Port: `5678`

2. **Assign this Resource to a Group** that your Twingate user or device is in.

3. **Open the Twingate Client** on your device, and go to:

   ```
   http://192.168.1.42:5678
   ```

   Or whatever private DNS alias you use.

### ðŸ§  Pro Tip

If you want to simplify things long-term, consider:

* Setting up **a reverse proxy + domain** (e.g., `n8n.local`) on the Pi.
* Configuring **Twingate DNS overrides** for friendly access like `http://n8n.internal`.
