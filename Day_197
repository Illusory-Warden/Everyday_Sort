## ✅ **Project Summary: CSBS Student Login System**

### 📦 **Project Name:** `Login_App_V2`

---

### 🎯 **Goal:**

To build a **secure login and logout web portal** for your **CSBS classmates**, using their **UID + password + verified email** stored in a database.

---

### 🏗️ **Current Features Implemented**

#### ✅ **Frontend**

* `index.html`:
  A clean login form with fields for:

  * **UID**
  * **Password**
  * **Email**
    Linked to `login.php` for processing.

* `index.css`:
  Styles for layout, responsiveness, and form design.

* `forgot.html` + `forgot.css`:
  Optional UI for users who forget their password (not fully functional yet).

---

#### ✅ **Backend**

* `db.php`:
  Connects to MySQL database `CSBS_DATA`.

* `login.php`:

  * Validates UID and Email from the `students` table.
  * Verifies password using PHP `password_verify()`
  * Starts a secure session and redirects to `welcome.php` if login is successful.

* `rehash_passwords.php`:

  * Automatically regenerates and hashes default passwords for all students.
  * Format: `Csbs@<last3_digits_of_UID>`
  * Updates the `password` field in the DB securely.

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

* Passwords are stored as **secure hashes**
* Sessions are used for login state
* All login inputs are validated
* Future scope: HTTPS + rate-limiting + password reset flow
