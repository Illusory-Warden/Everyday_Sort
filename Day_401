* **Curd (in South Asia, "dahi")** → Made by adding a bit of existing curd (with natural lactic acid bacteria) to warm milk. The bacteria vary depending on environment and starter, so its microbial profile isn’t always consistent.
* **Yogurt (industrial/Western style)** → Made using *specific* strains: usually *Lactobacillus bulgaricus* and *Streptococcus thermophilus*, sometimes with added probiotics like *Lactobacillus acidophilus* or *Bifidobacteria*.

### Nutritional & Health Comparison

**1. Protein & Nutrients**

* Both yogurt and curd provide good amounts of **protein, calcium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin**.
* Yogurt tends to have slightly more protein (especially Greek yogurt) and is sometimes fortified with vitamin D.

**2. Digestibility & Gut Health**

* Curd: Contains beneficial bacteria, but strains are less consistent, so probiotic benefits vary.
* Yogurt: Has standardized strains proven to survive digestion and reach the gut, which makes it more reliable as a **probiotic food**.

**3. Lactose Tolerance**

* Both curd and yogurt are easier to digest than milk, since bacteria partially break down lactose.
* Yogurt, especially with probiotic strains, is usually better tolerated by people with lactose sensitivity.

**4. Immune & Metabolic Benefits**

* Yogurt (with added probiotics) is linked in studies to better gut microbiome balance, possible immune support, and improved digestion.
* Curd is still very healthy and traditional, but its probiotic effects are less predictable.

✅ **Bottom line:** Both are nutritious and good for gut health, but **yogurt (with live cultures) is usually considered more consistently probiotic and thus more beneficial**.
If you prefer the traditional taste and freshness, curd is excellent. If you want standardized probiotic benefits, yogurt is the better choice.
