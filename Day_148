This means the Aaple Sarkar portal's **"Track Application"** service is **temporarily down**, which is unfortunately common with many Indian government portals due to traffic or maintenance.

### ✅ Here’s What You Can Do Next:

#### 🕒 1. **Try Again Later (Best Time: Morning or Late Night)**

* These errors often clear up within a few hours.
* Try again between **6 AM – 10 AM** or **after midnight** when the site traffic is lower.

Use the same tracking link again:

#### 🛠️ 2. **Use a Different Browser**

Sometimes Brave blocks scripts or cookies by default. Try the portal in:

* **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**
* **Disable ad-blockers** or shields (especially in Brave)

#### 🏢 3. **Visit the Nearest Maha e-Seva Kendra**

Since your message says the certificate is **approved and ready**, the fastest solution is:

👉 **Go to your local Maha e-Seva Kendra and show them this Application ID: `2559`**

Tell them:

> “I received SMS that a certificate has been issued under this Application ID, but I don’t recognize it. Can you check whose name and details it was issued under?”

They can:

* Verify the details on their internal portal
* Tell you if your phone number was just used accidentally, or if your identity was actually used
* Help you file a complaint if needed
