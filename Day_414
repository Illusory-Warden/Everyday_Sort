## 🔥 Savage / Kahtarnak Points

1. **“If you want freedom, walk around naked” remark**

   * Khattar once said that if women want freedom, then “why don’t they just roam around naked?” implying that women’s freedom must have boundaries set by others. ([Wikipedia][1])
   * This goes down badly: seen as blaming women for harassment, curtailing basic personal freedoms, promoting patriarchal norms.

2. **Blaming victims in sexual harassment / rape cases**

   * He claimed that in “80-90% of rape and eve-teasing cases, the person who accuses and the accused *know each other*, often arguing just once, then lodging an FIR saying rape…” ([Wikipedia][1])
   * Such statements are used by critics to say he's downplaying the seriousness of sexual violence, shifting responsibility to victims.

3. **“Fixing” a Judge remark**

   * He was criticised for saying that a judge needed to be “fixed” after delays in recruitment cases. Critics said this was interference with the judiciary. ([Wikipedia][1])
   * Even though he later expressed regret and said the remark was “unintentional,” it damaged his credibility in terms of respecting institutional boundaries. ([The Times of India][2])

4. **Handling of public grievances (“Janata Darbar” controversies)**

   * During his “Jansamvad” (public meetings), there were incidents where he lost his temper, used harsh words, and allegedly directed police to restrain or silence opposition and protesters. ([India Today][3])
   * For example, at Sirsa, a Congress leader says opposition leaders were confined to their homes during the Jansamvad. ([India Today][3])
   * There was also a reported public snub: when a woman whose husband died from drug abuse tried to speak up, he told her to sit down, saying he was her son — “Main tera beta hu na… kahin se sikha karke bheja hai tujhe” (approx: “I am like a son to you; you’ve come here after being taught to say these things”). Critics saw this as condescending and dismissive. ([India Today][3])

5. **Allegations of inaction / failure in environment / agriculture (stubble burning, etc.)**

   * Parties like AAP have demanded his resignation for failing to curb farm fires and the rising incidents of stubble burning. Critics say each year the incidents increase and the government has inadequate strategy and enforcement. ([The New Indian Express][4])

6. **Unemployment figures dispute**

   * Khattar has consistently argued that opposition parties are misleading people by using inflated unemployment statistics from private agencies. He claims that according to state-data (through “Parivar Pehchan Patra”), unemployment is just 5-6%. Critics argue the private agencies’ higher numbers better capture the ground reality. ([The Hindu][5])

7. **Accusations of politicising issues / divisive tactics**

   * Using caste census discussions, charges that Congress considers caste as vote bank, etc. Critics say Khattar similarly uses rhetoric that polarizes communities. ([indianeconomicobserver.com][6])
   * He has called out the Congress for taking a long time to elect their Legislature Party leader, saying it reflects confusion. Opponents say this is just political posturing. ([The Times of India][7])

8. **Religious / communal tension-fueling statements**

   * He made statements about “namaz in open spaces” not being tolerated, urging solutions but saying such religious expressions shouldn’t infringe on others. Critics interpret this as stoking communal discomfort. ([Reddit][8])

9. **“Freebies vs work-ethic” war of words**

   * Criticising other parties for giving out freebies, saying that instead of “get free stuff”, govt should focus on skill development etc. Opponents call it hypocritical, especially if public services are lacking or accessibility is a problem. ([India Today][9])
