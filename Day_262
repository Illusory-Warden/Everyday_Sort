### 1. Open Terminal

Navigate to the folder where your `.deb` file is located. For example, if it’s in `~/Downloads`:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

---

### 2. Install the `.deb` package

Use `apt` (preferred over `dpkg` because it will handle dependencies automatically):

```bash
sudo apt install ./<filename>.deb
```

Replace `<filename>.deb` with the actual file name, for example:

```bash
sudo apt install ./code_1.102.35058_amd64.deb
```

> ⚠️ Note: Make sure to include `./` if you’re in the same directory as the file.

---

### 3. Alternative: Using `dpkg` (manual dependency fix)

You could also use:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb
```

If there are missing dependencies, fix them with:

```bash
sudo apt install -f
```

---

### 4. Launch VS Code

After installation, you can start VS Code with:

```bash
code
```

or find it in your application menu.

---

After this, you can install **Remote-SSH** in the official VS Code and it should work properly.
