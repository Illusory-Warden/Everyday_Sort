Based on your setup, I'll guide you through configuring Gigolo on your Parrot OS laptop to connect to your Raspberry Pi NAS running Open Media Vault.

Looking at your screenshots, I can see you have:
- A shared folder named "NAS" 
- FTP service configured on your OMV
- The default FTP port 21

Here's how to configure Gigolo:

## Step-by-Step Configuration:

### 1. **Basic Bookmark Settings:**
- **Name:** Give it a descriptive name like "RPI NAS" or "Home NAS"
- **Color:** Choose any color for easy identification
- **Auto-Connect:** Enable this if you want it to connect automatically

### 2. **Connection Settings:**
- **Service type:** Keep it as "FTP" (as shown in your screenshot)
- **Server:** Enter `192.168.100.100` (your RPI's IP address)

### 3. **Optional Information:**
- **Port:** Keep it as `21` (default FTP port)
- **Folder:** Enter `/NAS/` (this is your shared folder path)
- **User Name:** Enter the username you configured in OMV for FTP access

### 4. **Authentication:**
When you click "Add" and try to connect, Gigolo will prompt you for:
- **Password:** Enter the password for the FTP user you configured in OMV

## Alternative Connection Methods:

If you want better performance and security, consider these alternatives:

### **Option 1: SMB/CIFS (Recommended)**
If you have SMB/CIFS enabled in OMV:
- Service type: "Windows share"
- Server: `192.168.100.100`
- Folder: `NAS`

### **Option 2: SFTP (More Secure)**
If SSH is enabled on your RPI:
- Service type: "SSH"
- Server: `192.168.100.100`
- Port: `22`
- User Name: Your SSH username (usually `pi` or whatever you configured)

## Troubleshooting Tips:

1. **Ensure FTP is enabled** in your OMV web interface
2. **Check firewall settings** on both devices
3. **Verify the shared folder permissions** in OMV
4. **Test connection** from terminal first: `ftp 192.168.100.100`

## Quick Test:
Before using Gigolo, you can test the connection via terminal:
```bash
ftp 192.168.100.100
# Enter username and password when prompted
# Type 'ls' to see if you can list files
# Type 'quit' to exit
```

Once configured properly in Gigolo, you should be able to browse and access your NAS files directly from your Parrot OS file manager. The mounted share will typically appear under `/media/` or in your file manager's network section.
