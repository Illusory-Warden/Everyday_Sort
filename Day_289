### Quick clarifications:

1. **Plastic containers for shipping**:

   * Do you want **one large container** (e.g., 10-liter airtight plastic bin) or **multiple smaller containers**?
   * If multiple, could you estimate total volume needed (e.g., enough to hold all printed parts and some space)?

2. **Bubble wrap & black foam**:

   * Would you like me to budget for a **roll of bubble wrap** (e.g., 50 m roll) and a **sheet of black PE or EVA foam** (e.g., size A1 sheet thickness 5–10 mm), or are you thinking per-part cut pieces? Rough dimensions would help.

Once I get these, I’ll compile a **detailed BOM** with:

* Sr. No.
* Item
* Quantity
* Line cost (total)
* Link to purchase or fare info
* Grand total at bottom
