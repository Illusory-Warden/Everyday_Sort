An **IEEE Member** is someone who has an active membership with the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**, which is the worldâ€™s largest professional association for advancing technology.

ðŸ‘‰ **Why it matters for conferences like I-SMAC 2025 or IDICAIHEI 2025:**

* IEEE members usually get **discounted registration fees** for conferences, workshops, and journals.
* They also have access to IEEE Xplore (a huge digital library of research papers), networking opportunities, and career development resources.
* When you see two prices (e.g., **USD 130 for IEEE members vs USD 150 for non-members**), the lower one applies only if you have an active IEEE membership and can provide your **IEEE Membership ID** at registration.
