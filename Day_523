# **Relationship Between Capabilities & Processes**

## **1. Capability = WHAT the organization can do**

A capability is a **skill or ability**, like:

* Deliver products fast
* Provide excellent customer service
* Innovate new products
* Produce at low cost

It describes the **outcome** the company is good at achieving.

---

## **2. Process = HOW the organization performs that capability**

A process is a **sequence of steps or activities** that makes the capability possible.

Examples:

* Order fulfillment steps
* Manufacturing steps
* Hiring and training steps
* Customer support steps

Processes are the **actions**, capability is the **result**.

---

## **3. Capabilities depend on processes**

A company **cannot have a capability** unless it has strong, efficient processes behind it.

### Example:

**Capability:** Fast delivery
**Processes needed:**

* Quick order processing
* Efficient warehouse operations
* Optimized shipping routes

---

## **4. Processes improve capabilities**

If the processes become more efficient, the capability becomes stronger.

### Example:

When Amazon improved its warehouse automation process →
Its **capability** of “same-day delivery” also strengthened.

---

## **5. Capabilities are stable; processes can change**

* Capabilities describe long-term strengths
* Processes can be redesigned, automated, or improved to support those strengths

---

## **In Simple Words**

**Capabilities describe what the company can do well.
Processes describe how the company does it.
Good processes create strong capabilities.**
