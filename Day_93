🏛️ Dada Darbar, Khandwa (His Samadhi Shrine)

Location: Built over his tomb (samadhi), about 1–3 km south of Khandwa railway and bus stations. A massive public trust ashram now surrounds it  .

Continuous flame ("dhuni"): The sacred fire he lit in 1930 remains alight to this day. Devotees believe offerings (like dried coconut or chana) thrown into it bring blessings  .

No priests, always open: It operates 24/7, without appointed priests—worshippers themselves offer prayers, flowers, sweet tidbits (“tikkad” or “chatni”), and perform havan (fire rituals)  .
