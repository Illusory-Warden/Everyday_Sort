Letâ€™s solve this carefully step by step.

Weâ€™re given the GP:
[
2, -6, 18, \ldots
]

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Identify the first term and common ratio

[
a = 2
]

To find the common ratio (r):
[
r = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
]

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Formula for the (n)th term of a geometric progression

[
u_n = a , r^{,n-1}
]

Substitute (a = 2), (r = -3), and (n = 7):

[
u_7 = 2 \times (-3)^{7 - 1} = 2 \times (-3)^6
]

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Simplify

[
(-3)^6 = 729
]
[
u_7 = 2 \times 729 = 1458
]

---

âœ… **Final Answer:**
[
\boxed{u_7 = 1458}
]
