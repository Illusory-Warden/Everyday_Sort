Based on the measured distance, different colored LEDs light up: Green LED when objects are far away (safe distance), Yellow LED when objects are at medium distance (caution), and Red LED when objects are too close (warning). This is perfect for understanding proximity detection and provides visual feedback of distance ranges without needing a display screen.

## 5. Temperature Alert System

**What it does:** This environmental monitoring system continuously measures room temperature using a DHT11 or LM35 temperature sensor. When the temperature is in the comfortable range (18-26°C), a green LED stays on indicating everything is normal.

Optional: An LCD display can show the actual temperature reading in degrees Celsius.

**Real-world applications:**

## 6. Sound Sensor Light

**What it does:** This sound-activated lighting system uses a sound sensor module to detect loud noises like clapping, talking loudly, or knocking. When the sensor detects sound above a certain threshold, the LED lights up for a few seconds, then automatically turns off. This is simpler than specific clap detection as it responds to any loud sound. Students can adjust the sensitivity of the sound sensor using its built-in potentiometer. This project demonstrates sound-based automation and smart home concepts.

## 7. Mission Impossible Timer

**What it does:** Inspired by the famous Mission Impossible movie countdown scenes, this project creates a dramatic countdown timer that displays time on a display screen. When activated by pressing a button, it counts down from 60 seconds (or any set time). As time runs out, a red LED blinks faster and faster, and a buzzer beeps with increasing urgency. When the timer reaches zero, the buzzer sounds continuously and the red LED stays on - "Mission Failed!" A reset button allows you to start the countdown again. This project is exciting and teaches time-based programming.

**Real-world applications:**

- Kitchen cooking timers
- Exam countdown timers
- Sports training interval timers
- Industrial process timers
- Game show countdown displays
