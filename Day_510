26. Define BFS with the help of example. 
27. Define DFS with the help of example. 
28. Discuss the following search Technique with the help of an example. Also discuss the 
benefits and shortcoming of each.  
I. 
II. 
Breadth First Search.  
Depth First Search. 
29. Give an example of a problem for which breadth first search would work better than 
depth first search. 
30. What are the applications of BFS? 
31. What are the applications of DFS?  
32. How will you measure the problem-solving performance?  
ANS:-Problem solving performance is measured with 4 factors. 
1) Completeness - Does the algorithm (solving procedure) surely finds solution if really 
the solution exists.  
2) Optimality – If multiple solutions exits then do the algorithm returns optimal amongst 
them. 
3) Time requirement. 
4) Space requirement. 
33. Explain the concept of Bidirectional Search.
