## ✅ Meaning of **O(b^m)**

* **b** = *branching factor*:
  the average number of children each node has.

* **m** = *maximum depth* of the search (or the depth limit, if DFS).

So **O(b^m)** describes how the number of nodes grows **exponentially** with depth.

More depth → exponentially more nodes → more time and memory.

## 📌 Why O(b^m)?

If each node has **b** children, then:

* Level 0 has 1 node
* Level 1 has b nodes
* Level 2 has b² nodes
* …
* Level m has b^m nodes

Total nodes explored in the worst case ≈ b^m
➡️ Hence **O(b^m)**.

## 📘 Examples

* If each node has **b = 3** children and depth **m = 5**, then:
  nodes ≈ 3⁵ = 243

* If you increase depth by just 1 →
  nodes multiply by 3 (exponential!).
