## ✅ **Time Complexity of DFS**

The time complexity depends on how the graph is represented.

### **1. Adjacency List Representation**

* Visiting every vertex: **O(V)**
* Traversing every edge: **O(E)**
  ➡️ **Total: O(V + E)**

This is the most common representation.

### **2. Adjacency Matrix Representation**

* For each vertex, scanning an entire row of size V
  ➡️ **O(V²)**

---

## ✅ **Space Complexity of DFS**

DFS requires space for:

### **1. Recursion stack** (or an explicit stack)

* Worst-case depth of recursion = **O(V)**

### **2. Visited array / bookkeeping**

* Also **O(V)**

➡️ **Total Space: O(V)**

> If the graph is very deep (like a long chain), DFS recursion stack can reach V calls.

## 📌 **Final Summary**

| Representation   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Adjacency List   | **O(V + E)**    | **O(V)**         |
| Adjacency Matrix | **O(V²)**       | **O(V)**         |
