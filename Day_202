The problematic part is:

```java
System.out.println("The total sum of the " + number + " is " + sumDigits(13));
```

### ❌ What's wrong:

* `number` is not defined in the `main` method, so this will cause a **"cannot find symbol"** compilation error.

---

### ✅ Fix:

Replace it with:

```java
int number = 13;
System.out.println("The total sum of the digits in " + number + " is " + sumDigits(number));
