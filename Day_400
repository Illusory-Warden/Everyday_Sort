```
PS C:\Users\rpi\Dektop\THESCAM>
```

That means you are **inside the “ THESCAM” folder**, which is located **on your Dektop**.

If you want to go **to the Desktop itself**, you can move **one level up** with this command:

```powershell
cd ..
```

After that, your prompt should look like this:

```
PS C:\Users\rpi\Dektop>
```

✅ **Summary:**

* `cd ..` → move **up one folder**
* `cd Dektop` → move **into the Desktop folder** (from your user folder)
* `cd C:\Users\rpi\Dektop` → go **directly** to the Desktop folder from anywhere

---

**Examples:**

* From your current location (`C:\Users\rpi\Dektop\THESCAM`)
  → Run:

  ```powershell
  cd ..
  ```
* From anywhere (e.g., `C:\`)
  → Run:

  ```powershell
  cd C:\Users\rpi\Dektop
  ```
