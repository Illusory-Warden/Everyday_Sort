Excellent. This line confirms everything is correct:

```
Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp
```

That means:

* Container is running ✅
* Port 8080 is exposed correctly ✅
* Service is listening on all interfaces ✅

Now just open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

If you're inside a VM (like Kali in VirtualBox/VMware), and it doesn't open:

Use:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

OR check your VM network mode (NAT vs Bridged).

If the page loads → 🎉 You're done.

If it doesn't load:

Run this quick test inside terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

If you see HTML output, the service is working and it’s just a browser/network issue.

You're officially running a self-hosted IT-Tools instance now.

If you want, I can show you how to:

* Run it on a custom domain
* Put it behind Nginx
* Add HTTPS
* Or integrate it into your homelab properly

What’s your next move?
