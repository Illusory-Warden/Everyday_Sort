### üîÅ **Core Stages of Design Thinking**

Most commonly, Design Thinking follows **five stages** (as outlined by Stanford's d.school and IDEO):

1. **Empathize**

   * Understand users through observation and interaction
   * Discover their needs, challenges, and motivations

2. **Define**

   * Synthesize insights from the empathy phase
   * Clearly articulate the problem or opportunity

3. **Ideate**

   * Brainstorm a wide range of creative solutions
   * Encourage wild ideas and defer judgment

4. **Prototype**

   * Build simple, inexpensive versions of the ideas
   * Make ideas tangible for feedback

5. **Test**

   * Try out prototypes with real users
   * Learn what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and refine the solution
