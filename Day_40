🔍 Overview
Intel Corporation is an American multinational technology company, most famous for designing and manufacturing microprocessors — the "brains" inside most of the world's computers.

Founded: July 18, 1968

Founders: Gordon Moore (of Moore’s Law fame) and Robert Noyce

Headquarters: Santa Clara, California, USA

CEO (as of 2024): Pat Gelsinger

🧠 What Intel Does
Intel makes:

Microprocessors: Like the Intel Core series (i3, i5, i7, i9), which power most PCs.

Chipsets: To support CPUs in motherboards.

Integrated Graphics: Intel UHD or Iris Xe graphics in laptops and desktops.

Server and Data Center Products: Xeon processors, used in enterprise systems.

AI & Edge Computing: They're getting deeper into AI chips and technologies for self-driving cars (especially after buying Mobileye).

🏭 Manufacturing
Intel is known for fab ownership — it builds and operates its own semiconductor manufacturing facilities (fabs). This is different from companies like AMD, which design chips but outsource manufacturing.

They're pushing Intel Foundry Services to make chips for other companies too, competing with TSMC and Samsung.

📈 Recent Moves
Reinvesting heavily in U.S.-based manufacturing (e.g., fabs in Arizona and Ohio).

Competing hard with AMD, Apple Silicon, and NVIDIA.

Trying to regain leadership in process technology (e.g., moving toward Intel 3 and Intel 18A nodes).

🎯 Fun Fact
The name “Intel” comes from “Integrated Electronics.” It was almost named "Moore-Noyce" — but that sounded too much like “more noise,” which wasn’t ideal for a chip company 😄
