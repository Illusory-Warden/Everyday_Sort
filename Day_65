**Telnet** (short for **Teletype Network**) is a **network protocol** and command-line tool used to remotely access and manage devices over a **TCP/IP network**, typically on **port 23**.

### Key Points:

* **Purpose**: It allows users to **log into remote machines** and issue commands as if they were physically present at the system.
* **Protocol Type**: **Text-based**, **unencrypted**, and **connection-oriented**.
* **Typical Use Cases** (historically):

  * Remote server administration.
  * Testing and troubleshooting network services (like checking if a port is open).
  * Accessing routers, switches, and legacy systems.

### Security Note:

* Telnet is **insecure** because it **transmits data, including passwords, in plaintext**, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
* It's largely replaced by **SSH (Secure Shell)** in modern systems, which provides encrypted communication.
