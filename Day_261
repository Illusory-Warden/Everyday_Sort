### 1. Open a terminal

### 2. Navigate to the Downloads folder

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

---

### 3. Install the `.deb` package with `apt`

```bash
sudo apt install ./code_1.103.0-1754517494_amd64.deb
```

This will install VS Code and automatically handle any dependencies.

---

### 4. Verify installation

```bash
code --version
```

You should see something like `1.103.0` printed in the terminal.

---

### 5. Launch VS Code

```bash
code
```

Or open it from your applications menu.

---

After this, you can install **Remote-SSH** in the official VS Code, and it should work without the “only supported in Microsoft versions” error.
