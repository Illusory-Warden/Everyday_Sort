YAGNI stands for "You Aren’t Gonna Need It."

What it means:

Don’t build something until you actually need it.

Developers often try to anticipate future features or requirements and write extra code “just in case.” YAGNI says: don’t do that—focus only on what’s required right now.

Why it matters:

Saves time and effort.

Keeps your codebase cleaner and smaller.

Avoids over-engineering.

Makes changes easier later because there’s less “unused” complexity to untangle.


Example:

Say you're building a blog app. You think, “Maybe one day, users will want to export posts as PDFs.” So you start adding a PDF export feature now, even though no one has asked for it yet.

YAGNI would say: Don’t build that feature until there’s a real need.

In short:
Only build what you need—when you need it.
