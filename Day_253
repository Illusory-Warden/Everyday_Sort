## **Ford’s DMAIC Approach under Six Sigma**

**1. Define**

* **Goal**: Improve customer satisfaction by reducing defects and warranty issues.
* In the **Transit Protection Film Project**, the problem was paint damage on exported vehicles due to poor-quality protective film during shipping.
* The project team defined the target: reduce exterior paint defects per vehicle by at least 50% and cut costs.

---

**2. Measure**

* Collected baseline data:

  * Average of **2.89 defects per vehicle** during transit.
  * Cost impact of defects + rework.
* Mapped the process from plant application of film to arrival at the customer.

---

**3. Analyze**

* Used statistical tools and Design of Experiments (DOE) to identify root causes:

  * Low-grade protective film quality.
  * Inconsistent application process at plants.
  * Inadequate operator training and oversight.
* Determined that material quality and process control were the main drivers of defects.

---

**4. Improve**

* Switched to higher-quality protective film.
* Standardized the application process.
* Trained operators and improved supervision.
* Moved film application from manufacturing plants to **port-processing centers** to improve efficiency and reduce floor space usage.

---

**5. Control**

* Developed process control charts to monitor defect rates.
* Established regular audits and supplier quality checks.
* Defect rate dropped to **1.03 per vehicle** (about 64% reduction).
* Annual savings exceeded **\$500,000**, surpassing Ford’s minimum project savings target of \$250,000.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* Ford’s DMAIC projects directly tied **quality improvements** to **financial outcomes**.
* The focus on customer impact (“Consumer-Driven”) ensured projects were not just about cost but also about long-term brand reputation.
