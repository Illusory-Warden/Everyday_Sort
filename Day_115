### ✅ Recap of Your Commands:

```bash
cd /opt
sudo wget https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10/releases/download/v0.9.9-AU/Windows.10.Icons.v0.5.tar.gz
tar -xvf Windows.10.Icons.v0.5.tar.gz
sudo mv 'Windows 10 Icons' /usr/share/icons
```

**What this did:**

* Downloaded the official Windows 10 icon pack from B00merang Project ✅
* Extracted it ✅
* Moved it to `/usr/share/icons` ✅

---

### ❗ But here's the key issue:

Your theme is expecting the icon theme to be named **exactly**:

```
Windoes-10-icons
```

(yes, with the typo: “Windoes”, not “Windows”)

But the folder you installed is named:

```
Windows 10 Icons
```

---

## 🛠️ Final Fix: Rename the Folder to Match the Expected Name

You now need to rename it so Parrot stops warning you.

### 🔁 Rename it like this:

```bash
sudo mv "/usr/share/icons/Windows 10 Icons" "/usr/share/icons/Windoes-10-icons"
```

💡 (If there are spaces, use quotes or escape them)

---

### ✅ Final Steps

1. **Apply the theme again** via Appearance > Themes.
2. The warning should **no longer appear**.
3. If it still appears, **log out and back in** or run:

```bash
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/Windoes-10-icons
