**IPS** and **VESA** are *not directly comparable* because they refer to **different things**:

* **IPS** is a **type of panel technology** (affects image quality).
* **VESA** is a **mounting standard** (affects how you can physically mount the monitor).

So the real comparison is not “IPS vs VESA,” but what **panel types** are better — usually **IPS vs VA vs TN**.

## 🧠 What each term means

### 📌 **IPS (In-Plane Switching)**

This is a **panel technology** used in LCD monitors.

**Pros:**
✅ Best color accuracy and wide viewing angles
✅ Good contrast for everyday use
✅ Consistent image quality from different angles

**Cons:**
⚠ Slightly slower response times than TN (but modern IPS can still be very fast)
⚠ Usually a bit more expensive

**Best for:**
👨‍💻 Productivity, creative work, movies, gaming (especially higher refresh models)

### 📌 **VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association)**

This refers to a **mounting pattern standard** — not a panel type.

E.g., **VESA 100 × 100 mm** means the monitor has screw holes in a standard pattern so you can use a **wall mount / arm mount**.

So VESA = *mounting support*, not image quality.

### Summary

* **IPS** — Best overall image and color; excellent for gaming, movies, work.
* **VA** — Best true contrast and deep blacks; good for movies and general use.
* **TN** — Fastest response time; OK colors; mostly for very cheap gaming-only panels.

## 🏆 Conclusion

Since you’re choosing a **27″ monitor with ≥120 Hz**, the panel hierarchy in *most balanced order* is:

👉 **IPS > VA > TN** for most users

> Most high-refresh monitors under ₹16k that are 27″ use **IPS panels**, because they give the best mix of colors, viewing angles, and performance.

## 🧩 And VESA?

If a monitor supports **VESA mounting**, it just means you can mount it on a wall/arm easily — super useful if you want a clean desk setup. But **VESA says nothing about picture quality**.

## ✔ Recommendation for you

📍 Since you want:

* **27″**
* **≥120 Hz**
* **Flat panel**
* **QHD / WQHD**

➡ **IPS panel** is the *best choice* for image quality and gaming balance.
