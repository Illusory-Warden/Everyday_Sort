Here’s the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category ASC;
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* `SUM(quantity_sold)` adds up all products sold for each category.
* `GROUP BY category` groups sales data by category.
* `ORDER BY category ASC` sorts results alphabetically by category.

### Expected Output:

| category    | total\_quantity\_sold |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Clothing    | 15                    |
| Electronics | 61                    |
| Furniture   | 26                    |
