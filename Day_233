## 🎨 What Are Themes in Gamma (and Why They Matter)?

A theme controls how your whole presentation looks — colors, fonts, layout, and vibe. In the Gamma prompt, the suggested theme is:

* 🔵 Color Palette: Blue, white, and dark shades (black, navy, or charcoal) — to reflect the “blue light” theme and give a modern, science-tech feel.
* 🌃 Background Style: Slightly glowing or gradient backgrounds, hinting at LED lights or energy.
* ✍️ Font Style: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts (like Inter, Roboto, or Montserrat).
* 🎞 Slide Layouts: Visual-first layouts (big images or diagrams, short text bullets).
* 💫 Animation: Subtle fade-ins or light zooms — avoid flashy transitions.

The goal: Make it feel like a documentary meets TED talk — clean, minimal, and glowing with blue energy.
