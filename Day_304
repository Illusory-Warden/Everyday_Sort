Here’s the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
HAVING SUM(quantity_sold) >= 30
ORDER BY category ASC;
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* `SUM(quantity_sold)` calculates the total sold per category.
* `GROUP BY category` groups the sales records by category.
* `HAVING SUM(quantity_sold) >= 30` filters categories to include only those with **30 or more units sold**.
* `ORDER BY category ASC` sorts results alphabetically.

### Expected Output:

| category    | total\_quantity\_sold |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Electronics | 61                    |
