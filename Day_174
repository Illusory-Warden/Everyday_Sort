> ❌ `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`

---

## ✅ Solution: Run Docker with `sudo`

Docker needs root privileges unless you've configured it for non-root users.

### 🔧 Fix 1: Use `sudo` for now

Just prefix your commands like this:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

Check containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

This will work immediately.

## ✅ (Optional but Recommended) Fix 2: Add Your User to the `docker` Group

This avoids needing `sudo` every time.

### Run these:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then **log out and back in**, or run:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

Now you can run Docker without `sudo`.

### 🚀 Once That's Done, Try Again:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml --env-file .env up -d
