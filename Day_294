## Quick Setup: Making the Models “Naked” in OpenRocket

Once you’ve downloaded the desired `.ork` files:

1. Open the file in **OpenRocket**.
2. Navigate to **Component → Appearance**.
3. Set **Surface finish** to **None** and remove any decals or textures.
4. In the 3D view, the rocket will render as a plain, unpainted model—perfect for geometry-only simulation.
