After **31 July 2025**, your **20 bonus shares** will become tradable, and you will officially have:

> **20 original shares + 20 bonus shares = 40 shares in total**

### Important Notes:

* These **bonus shares are free**, so you **didn't pay anything extra** for them.
* Your **investment amount remains the same**, but your **average price per share will reduce** (because the cost is now spread over more shares).
* You'll see your **adjusted average price** (post-bonus) reflected in your holdings after the bonus shares become tradable.
