The notation **9!** is read as **“9 factorial.”**

---

### 🔹 Definition of Factorial

For any positive integer **n**,

$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1
$$

So:

$$
9! = 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
$$

### 🔹 Value of 9!

$$
9! = 362,880
$$

### 🔹 Why Factorials matter in 8-puzzle

* There are **9 positions** (8 tiles + 1 blank).
* The total number of ways to arrange them = **9! = 362,880** possible states.
* But only **half of these are solvable** (≈181,440).

✅ So, **9! is “9 factorial,” the product of all integers from 1 to 9.*
