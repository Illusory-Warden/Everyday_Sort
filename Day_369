## üîπ 1. Where to Get Code & Pre-trained CNN Models

You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel ‚Äî there are tons of ready-to-use sources:

### **(a) GitHub**

* Search for repositories:

  * `"brain tumor classification CNN keras"`
  * `"lung cancer CNN pytorch"`
  * `"skin cancer classification transfer learning"`
* Example repos (you can adapt them):

  * [Brain Tumor Classification (Keras)](https://github.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-dataset)
  * [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset with CNN](https://github.com/GovindDixit/skin-cancer-detection)
  * [Lung Cancer Detection using CNN](https://github.com/bhaveshoswal/Lung-Cancer-Detection)

---

### **(b) Kaggle**

* Kaggle has both **datasets + code notebooks** (you can fork and run directly in the cloud).
* Example:

  * [Brain Tumor Classification using CNN (Kaggle Notebook)](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
  * [Skin Cancer Classification with EfficientNet](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
  * [Lung Cancer Classification (CNN + Transfer Learning)](https://www.kaggle.com/code)

üëâ On Kaggle, just search for your dataset name + ‚ÄúCNN‚Äù. You can then copy the notebook, swap in your dataset, and retrain.

### **(c) Pre-trained CNN Models in Frameworks**

* **TensorFlow/Keras** ‚Üí ready models in `tf.keras.applications`

  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB0
  ```
* **PyTorch** ‚Üí pre-trained models in `torchvision.models`

  ```python
  import torchvision.models as models
  resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
  ```
* **FastAI** ‚Üí easiest for quick experiments

  ```python
  from fastai.vision.all import *
  cnn_model = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
  ```

## üîπ 2. Where to Run the Code

You don‚Äôt even need a personal GPU ‚Äî here are free/cheap options:

* **Google Colab (Free, Cloud-based)**

  * Easiest playground for deep learning.
  * GPU support included (enable in settings).
  * Directly run Kaggle/GitHub notebooks.

* **Kaggle Notebooks (Free, Cloud-based)**

  * Similar to Colab, but more dataset-friendly.
  * Many datasets are already hosted, so no upload hassle.

* **Local Machine (if you have GPU)**

  * Install TensorFlow/PyTorch.
  * More control, but you need hardware (NVIDIA GPU recommended).

## üîπ 3. Datasets

Since you already have your **Brain Tumor, Lung Cancer, and Skin Cancer datasets**, you just need to:

* Upload them to **Google Drive (for Colab)** or **Kaggle Datasets (for Kaggle notebooks)**.
* Modify the **data loading section** in the notebook (usually a few lines).

---

‚úÖ **Best workflow for you:**

1. Use **Kaggle or Google Colab** (no hardware setup needed).
2. Fork a **ready-made notebook from Kaggle/GitHub**.
3. Plug in your dataset.
4. Train with **VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet** using transfer learning.
5. Collect accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
6. Compare results with your target research paper.
