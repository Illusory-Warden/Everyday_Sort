Yes, you’re exactly right 👍

With a **negative number (myopia / nearsightedness)**:

* **Near things** → clear (like your phone, book, or computer).
* **Far things** → blurry (like road signs, whiteboard, people’s faces at a distance).

That’s why glasses with negative power are given: they correct the blurriness for far objects.

Do you want me to also explain **why near is clear but far is blurry** in myopia, in simple terms?
