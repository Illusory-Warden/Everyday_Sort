1. **Print-farm mass**: What’s the **total estimated weight (in grams)** of all the parts the farm will print? (Rate is ₹15/gram, so this drives that line item.)

2. **Shipping containers & foam** (you said multiple smaller containers, skip/short bubble wrap):

   * How many **airtight plastic containers** do you want, and roughly what **capacity each** (e.g., 20 L, 30 L)?
   * **Foam for custom cutouts**: what **thickness** (e.g., 10 mm or 20 mm EVA/PE foam) and how many **sheets** (e.g., 1 m × 2 m sheets)?

Once I have those, I’ll generate the detailed BOM with:

* Sr. No
* Item name
* Quantity
* Total cost per item
* Purchase/booking link (IRCTC for tickets, product pages for items)
* **Grand total** at the bottom
