## üîê Where Hashing Happens

### ‚úÖ In `reset.php` (when resetting password)

```php
$hashed = password_hash($newpass, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
```

> This hashes the new password before saving it to the database.

---

### ‚úÖ In `login.php` (when logging in)

```php
if (password_verify($pass, $stored_hashed_password)) {
    $_SESSION['uid'] = $uid;
    header("Location: welcome.php");
}
```

> This verifies the entered password **against the hashed password** in your database.

## ‚ùóImportant Reminders

* Any password saved manually via SQL or an admin tool **must be hashed**, or login will fail.

  Example of inserting hashed password manually (optional):

  ```php
  INSERT INTO students (Student_UID, ..., password)
  VALUES ('23016001', ..., '$2y$10$u....'); -- hashed using PHP
  ```

* You cannot do something like:

  ```sql
  UPDATE students SET password = '1234' WHERE Student_UID = '23016001';
  ```

  ‚ùå That's a plain-text password. It won't work anymore.

## ‚úÖ You're Secure Now

* Passwords are **never stored in plain text**
* They are hashed using `password_hash()` with bcrypt
* They are verified securely using `password_verify()`
