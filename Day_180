**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include **learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding language**, and even **decision-making**.

In simple terms, AI enables machines to **mimic human cognitive functions**, allowing them to interpret data, learn from it, and make decisions based on that knowledge.

### **Techniques of AI:**

There are several core techniques used in AI, which can be broadly classified into the following categories:

---

#### **1. Machine Learning (ML):**

A subset of AI that allows systems to **learn from data** and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

* **Supervised Learning**: Trains the model on labeled data (e.g., spam detection).
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering customers).
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties (e.g., game playing).

---

#### **2. Deep Learning:**

A specialized form of machine learning using **artificial neural networks** with many layers. It is especially powerful for tasks like:

* Image recognition
* Natural language processing
* Speech recognition

---

#### **3. Expert Systems:**

These use a **knowledge base** of human expertise and an **inference engine** to solve complex problems. Example: medical diagnosis systems.

---

#### **4. Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

Allows machines to **understand, interpret, and generate human language**. Techniques include:

* Text analysis
* Sentiment analysis
* Language translation
* Chatbots and virtual assistants

---

#### **5. Computer Vision:**

Enables machines to **see and interpret visual data**. Key applications:

* Object detection
* Facial recognition
* Medical imaging analysis

---

#### **6. Fuzzy Logic:**

Used for reasoning that is **approximate rather than fixed and exact**. Useful in systems where decisions are made with uncertain or imprecise information (e.g., automatic climate control).

---

#### **7. Robotics:**

Combines AI with mechanical systems to create **autonomous agents** that can interact with the physical world, such as:

* Self-driving cars
* Industrial robots
* Drones

---

#### **8. Evolutionary Algorithms:**

Inspired by natural selection, these are used to **optimize complex problems** by evolving solutions over generations (e.g., genetic algorithms).
