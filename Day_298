## ❌ Not Covered Yet (by name / formally):

1. **Formal Definitions** of

   * Big-O (O)
   * Big-Omega (Ω)
   * Big-Theta (Θ)

2. **Properties of Asymptotic Notations**, such as:

   * Reflexivity
   * Transitivity
   * Symmetry (for Θ)
   * Addition rule
   * Multiplication/scaling rule

3. **Formal explanation of Best, Worst, and Average Case Analysis** with examples (searching/sorting).

4. **Difference between Worst-case complexity vs Upper bound** (subtle point many teachers ask).

5. **Graphical/Intuitive explanation of O, Ω, Θ** (how they sandwich a function).

✅ What we *did* cover are examples (like $2n+5$, $5n^2$), intuition about choosing constants, and informal talk about best/worst cases.
❌ What we *haven’t* covered yet is the **formal definitions + properties** (the theory side).
