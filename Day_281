### 1. **Can myopia go away on its own?**

* **No, myopia usually does not reverse naturally.**
* Once your eye shape has elongated (the cause of myopia), it generally stays that way.
* Sometimes, a *small reduction* can be seen if the first prescription was slightly over-corrected, but true repair is very rare.

### 2. **Can it be treated?**

There are a few approaches:

* **Glasses / Contact lenses** – Correct vision but don’t cure myopia.
* **Refractive surgery (LASIK, SMILE, PRK, etc.)** – Reshapes the cornea to reduce or eliminate the need for glasses. Effective, but only after your number is stable (usually after age 20–22).
* **Ortho-K (special night contact lenses)** – Temporarily reshapes the cornea while you sleep, giving clear vision during the day.
* **Lifestyle control** – Spending more time outdoors, limiting prolonged near work (like screens/reading), and good lighting can help slow progression, especially in children/teens.

### 3. **Future research**

Scientists are exploring methods to **slow or prevent progression** (like special eye drops called low-dose atropine, or new lens designs), but currently there’s no natural “cure” that reverses it completely.

👉 So, to sum up: **Myopia isn’t naturally repairable**, but it’s very manageable, and there are permanent correction options if your prescription is stable.
