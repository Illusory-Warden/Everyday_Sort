Here are the answers to your questions, each with a brief explanation:

1. **Which of the following allows us to identify objects and extract information?**  
   **a. RFID**  
   *RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is used to identify objects and extract stored information from tags attached to them.*

2. **How many layers does Zigbee consist of?**  
   **d. 4**  
   *The Zigbee protocol stack is often described in a simplified OSI-like model as consisting of four layers: Physical, MAC, Network, and Application layers. Note, sometimes more sub-layers are discussed, but standard multiple-choice sources typically note 4 layers as the answer[1][2][3].*

3. **Which of the following is not a component of cloud computing?**  
   **b. Local Servers**  
   *Clients, Services, and Applications are all core to cloud computing, whereas Local Servers are specific to traditional IT infrastructure and are not integral to cloud infrastructure hosting[4].*

4. **Which of the following is a distance measuring sensor module?**  
   **b. HC-SR04**  
   *The HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor module commonly used for distance measurement[5][6].*

5. **Which of the following is a component in a typical sensor network?**  
   **d. All of these**  
   *Typical sensor networks include sinks, gateways, and routers as part of their architecture[7][8].*

6. **Which of the following sensors are responsible for measuring orientation and angular velocity?**  
   **a. Accelerometer**  
   *Accelerometers can measure orientation, but for angular velocity, the correct sensor is typically a gyroscope. Among the given choices, accelerometer is the closest correct answer, as GPS and temperature sensors do not measure either property[9][10].*

7. **“ISA 100.11A” is a wireless networking technology standard. ISA stands for _______.**  
   **a. International Society of Automation**  
   *ISA is officially the International Society of Automation[11].*

8. **Which of the following is not a difference between traditional data center and cloud computing?**  
   **d. Storage**  
   *Both traditional data centers and cloud computing provide storage. Scalability, flexibility, and elasticity are unique advantages of the cloud[12].*

9. **Smart grid is also known as the energy internet.**  
   **a. True**  
   *Smart grids are often referred to as the "energy internet" due to their ability to use digital communication technology for efficient management and distribution of electricity[13][14].*

10. **Can a point of node failure result in the partition of the network in the stationary sensor network?**  
    **a. Yes**  
    *In stationary sensor networks, if a critical node fails (especially one functioning as a bridge), it can result in network partition, disrupting communication between network segments.*
