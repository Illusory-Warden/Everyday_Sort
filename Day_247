Installing Kali Linux as the **primary OS** on a Samsung Galaxy A32 would be *extremely* difficult and likely not worth the risk — for a few reasons:

---

### **Why it’s a problem on the A32**

1. **No official ARM build for A32**

   * Kali ARM images are made for specific devices (like some Raspberry Pi boards, PinePhone, etc.), and the A32 isn’t one of them.
   * Without a device-specific kernel + drivers, you’d lose most hardware functions.

2. **Locked-down bootloader**

   * While you *can* unlock the bootloader on many Samsung models, Samsung uses **Knox** security. Unlocking it will **permanently trip Knox**, void warranty, and disable some hardware-backed features forever.

3. **No mainline Linux support**

   * Mainline Linux (the generic Linux kernel) barely supports any modern Samsung Galaxy devices fully.
   * Even if you managed to flash Kali, things like **cellular calls, mobile data, camera, fingerprint reader** likely wouldn’t work.

4. **Modem firmware**

   * Phones like the A32 have proprietary modem firmware that is tightly integrated with Android. Pure Linux builds generally can’t use it, meaning **no calling or texting**.

### **What you *can* do instead**

If your goal is to have Kali tools on your A32:

* Install **Kali NetHunter** (the “Rootless” edition works without root, but root gives more features).
* Or use **UserLAnd** or **Termux + proot** to run a full Kali environment *inside* Android.
* This way you keep phone features *and* get Kali’s pentesting tools.
