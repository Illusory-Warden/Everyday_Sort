## Ford’s "Consumer-Driven Six Sigma" Case Study

### Program Launch & Approach

* **Initiation**: Six Sigma was formally adopted at Ford starting in **late 1999**, under the banner of **“Consumer-Driven Six Sigma”**. The initiative was intended to elevate vehicle quality and customer satisfaction dramatically.([ibscdc.org][1], [ibscdc.org][2])
* **DMAIC Framework**: Projects followed the structured DMAIC cycle—Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control—while top executives, including CEO Jacques Nasser, and 200 senior managers received executive training by January 2000.([ibscdc.org][1], [qualitydigest.com][3])

### Impact & Results

* Within its **first year**, the methodology delivered **\$52 million** in savings. Savings then climbed to **\$325 million** in fiscal 2001 and **\$359 million** in 2002.([ibscdc.org][4])
* Over time, Ford completed thousands of Six Sigma projects, achieving global savings in the **billion-dollar range**. By the early 2000s, total savings reached **\$1 billion** in waste elimination.([qualitydigest.com][3], [Scribd][5])
* Project accomplishments include over **9,500 completed projects**, yielding savings of **\$1.7 billion**, including **\$731 million in 2003** alone. Customer satisfaction also rose by approximately **five percentage points**.([Scribd][5])

### Detailed Example – Transit Protection Film Project

* **Problem**: Vehicles shipped for export suffered exterior paint damage due to poorly performing protective film used during transit.([saferpak.com][6])
* **Analysis & Intervention**:

  * Used DOE (Design of Experiments) and statistical tools to evaluate film material quality, operator training, and application supervision.
  * Switching to a better film and improving installation training reduced defects from **2.89 per vehicle (289%)** to **1.03 per vehicle (103%)**.([saferpak.com][6])
  * By shifting film application from manufacturing plants to port-processing centers, Ford freed up floor space and saved **over \$500,000** per project—exceeding their minimum savings target of \$250,000.([saferpak.com][6])

### Organizational Adoption & Culture Shift

* Ford trained extensively for Six Sigma roles: **200 Master Black Belts**, **2,200 Black Belts**, and nearly **40,000 Green Belts** globally, supported by around **3,000 Project Champions** to oversee initiatives.([qualitydigest.com][3])
* One notable project involved resolving body-side molding adhesion issues on the Ford Focus. After applying DMAIC, the project saved **\$100,000 annually** and eliminated complaints post-implementation.([qualitydigest.com][3])
* Six Sigma became ingrained in Ford’s operational culture, aligning waste reduction, cost savings, and customer focus.([ibscdc.org][2], [qualitydigest.com][3])
