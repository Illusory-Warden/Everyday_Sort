That log output means your connector container is stuck looping between **"Offline"** and **"Authentication"** states.
In Twingate terms, that’s almost always because **the connector’s authentication token is invalid or expired**.

Even if nothing changed in your Pi or network, this happens when:

* The token used to start the connector has a limited lifetime and was issued before your 3-day downtime.
* Twingate invalidated the token after a long period of disconnection.
* The container restarted but kept trying with the old token.

**The fix**:

1. Stop and remove the old containers:

   ```bash
   sudo docker rm -f 22d4 4b498b1d 52617d6c
   ```
2. In the Twingate admin console, create **a new connector** (or reissue token for an existing one). You’ll get a new Docker run command with a fresh token.
3. Deploy only **one** connector on the Pi using that new command.
