For the **OpenWeather API** request, you don’t need OAuth or special credentials — the API key you got is enough.

So in your **HTTP Request node**:

* **Authentication** → `None`

Because we’re already passing the key in the **Query Parameters** (`appid=your_api_key`).

---

Once that’s set, you’re ready to hit **Execute Node** and test if you get JSON back with the weather data 🌤️
