The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Each letter in SOLID stands for a specific principle:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change.
This means every class should focus on one task or responsibility only.


2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
You should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code.


3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
Subclasses must behave in a way that doesnâ€™t violate the expectations set by the parent class.


4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
It's better to have many small, specific interfaces than a large, general-purpose one.


5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Code should depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete implementations.
