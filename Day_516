Issue 1: Forward vs Backward Search



“The tree can be searched forward from the initial node to the goal state or backwards from the goal state to the initial state.”


2-unit

Forward Search (Goal-directed search)

Start from initial state

Apply operators

Move towards the goal

✔ Used when:

Initial state is known

Goal test is easy

Many possible goals

Examples:

8-puzzle

Water jug

Navigation problems

Backward Search (Reverse search)

Start from goal state

Apply inverse operators

Search backward until reaching the initial state

✔ Used when:

Goal state is clearly defined

Fewer possible goal states

Inverse rules are easy to compute

Examples:

Propositional logic proof

Expert systems

IDA* on some puzzles
