## 🇮🇳 **India vs 🇵🇰 Pakistan — Fighter Jet Strength (2025 Overview)**

| Category                           | **India**                                                            | **Pakistan**                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Combat Aircraft**         | ~650–700                                                             | ~350–400                                                             |
| **Main Fighters**                  | Su-30MKI, Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29UPG, HAL Tejas                  | JF-17 Thunder (Blk I–III), F-16 Fighting Falcon, J-10C, Mirage III/V |
| **5th Gen / Stealth Jets**         | Under development (HAL AMCA)                                         | None (future interest in J-31)                                       |
| **Multirole Capability**           | Strong – mix of heavy, medium, and light aircraft                    | Moderate – mostly light multirole fighters                           |
| **Technological Edge**             | AESA radars, Meteor & SCALP missiles (Rafale), BrahMos-A on Su-30MKI | J-10C has AESA radar, PL-15 BVR missile; F-16 still potent but aging |
| **Domestic Production**            | High (Tejas, upcoming AMCA)                                          | Moderate (JF-17 co-developed with China)                             |
| **Airborne Early Warning (AWACS)** | More systems (Netra, Phalcon)                                        | Fewer systems (Saab Erieye, ZDK-03)                                  |

## 🇮🇳 **India’s Advantages**

1. **Quantity & Variety:** India fields a much larger and more diverse fleet — including heavy air superiority fighters like the Su-30MKI and cutting-edge Rafales.
2. **Weapon Systems:** India’s access to weapons like the **Meteor BVR missile**, **SCALP**, and **BrahMos** gives it significant standoff strike capability.
3. **Training & Infrastructure:** IAF has more bases, better radar coverage, and superior pilot training infrastructure.
4. **Indigenous Capability:** India produces and upgrades many of its aircraft (HAL Tejas, AMCA, upgrades to Su-30s), improving self-reliance.

## 🇵🇰 **Pakistan’s Strengths**

1. **JF-17 Thunder (with China):** Cost-effective and modernizing quickly (Block III variant includes AESA radar and PL-15 missile).
2. **F-16 Fighting Falcons:** Still highly capable, especially with AMRAAMs and modern avionics.
3. **Chinese Support:** Pakistan has strong defense ties with China, including access to newer systems like the **J-10C** multirole jet.

## ⚖️ **Overall Air Power Balance**

* **Technologically & Numerically:** 🇮🇳 **India is clearly stronger** in both quality and quantity.
* **Pakistan’s Edge:** Modern Chinese jets (like J-10C) and the PL-15 long-range missile narrow the gap somewhat in **BVR (Beyond Visual Range)** combat.
* **Strategic Reality:** Pakistan’s air force is **smaller but agile**, optimized for defensive operations, while India’s IAF is **larger and multi-theatre capable** — able to project power deep into enemy territory.

| Aspect                           | Advantage                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Fleet Size & Diversity**       | 🇮🇳 India                                     |
| **Technology (Radar, Missiles)** | 🇮🇳 India (edge with Rafale)                  |
| **Modernization Speed**          | 🇵🇰 Pakistan (JF-17 Block III rollout faster) |
| **Pilot Skill & Training**       | 🇮🇳 India                                     |
| **Self-Reliance & Production**   | 🇮🇳 India                                     |
| **Cost Efficiency**              | 🇵🇰 Pakistan                                  |

✅ **Final Verdict (2025):**
India’s Air Force remains **significantly stronger overall** — both in numbers and advanced technology.
Pakistan’s newer additions (JF-17 Block III, J-10C) improve its capabilities, but they do **not surpass** India’s Rafale and Su-30MKI combination.
