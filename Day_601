* Live stealer/RAT samples
* Download locations
* Malware-sharing communities
* Underground repos, mirrors, or feeds
* “Sample packs” of real malicious code

That includes *even for simulations, research tools, or labs*.

Giving directions to obtain real payloads would directly enable malware distribution and misuse, which I can’t do.

## ✅ What I *can* do (this is how professionals actually handle it)

If your goal is **legitimate research or tooling**, there *are* **legal, controlled, and industry-accepted paths** to get **real samples** — but they require **proper guardrails**.

Below are the **only acceptable routes** used by security teams, vendors, and researchers.

---

## 🛡️ Legitimate ways researchers access real malware (high-level)

### 1️⃣ **Formal malware research agreements**

Used by:

* EDR vendors
* Universities
* CERTs
* SOCs

You get access to:

* Real samples
* Controlled feeds
* Legal protection

Usually requires:

* Institutional email
* Signed terms
* Proof of defensive use

---

### 2️⃣ **Academic / benchmark datasets**

These contain **real malware**, but:

* Heavily curated
* No live C2
* Often stripped of active infrastructure

Used for:

* ML research
* Detection benchmarking
* Tool validation

Common traits:

* Hash-only access
* Encrypted-at-rest samples
* Strong usage restrictions

---

### 3️⃣ **Commercial sandbox platforms**

This is the **most common** real-world approach.

You **do not download samples** at all.

Instead:

* Upload hashes
* Replay detonations
* Emulate execution
* Extract artifacts (logs, memory, files)

This is how tools like:

* EDR test harnesses
* SOC simulators
* Threat emulators
  are built **without ever redistributing malware**

---

### 4️⃣ **Red-team simulation frameworks (industry standard)**

What most serious tools do instead of bundling malware:

* Atomic-style behavior modules
* Payload stubs
* Protocol emulators
* Fake beacons
* Controlled RAT shells

⚠️ Important truth:

> **Real malware payloads are almost never bundled inside legitimate tools**
> Even red-team products don’t do that.

---

## 🚨 Why embedding real payloads is a bad idea (even for you)

Even aside from policy:

* ⚠️ You could accidentally distribute malware
* ⚠️ AV will flag your entire tool
* ⚠️ You risk legal exposure
* ⚠️ Users will be compromised if misused
* ⚠️ You can’t safely ship updates

This is *exactly* why vendors simulate behavior instead of shipping payloads.

---

## ✅ What I strongly recommend (and will fully help with)

Instead of “real payloads”, build **payload profiles**:

### Example:

```
payload_type: ClickFix_Stealer
initial_vector: clipboard
lolbins: [mshta, powershell]
persistence: registry_runkey
network_pattern: periodic_https_post
artifact_types: [txt, zip, exe_stub]
```

Then pair that with:

* Execution simulators
* Artifact generators
* Network emulators
* Log replayers

This gives you:
✔️ Realistic behavior
✔️ Real detections
✔️ Safe distribution
✔️ Zero legal risk
