## ✅ Recommended Setup for Headless Pi (Easy + Powerful): **Netdata**

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Installation (1 Command):

SSH into your Pi, then run:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

This installs everything needed, sets it to run as a service, and exposes the web dashboard.

---

### 🌐 Accessing the Dashboard:

After install, in your browser go to:

```
http://<your-pi-ip>:19999
```

*Replace `<your-pi-ip>` with the actual IP (e.g. `192.168.1.42`)*

---

### 📊 What You Get:

* Live graphs of:

  * CPU usage (core-wise)
  * RAM & swap
  * Disk I/O
  * Network bandwidth
  * Processes, system load
* No login required (local only by default)

---

### 🔐 Optional: Secure Access

For remote access outside your LAN (like from the internet), you'd want:

* A reverse proxy (e.g. Caddy or Nginx with HTTPS)
* A VPN (e.g. Tailscale)
* Or SSH tunneling (for secure remote port forwarding)

Let me know if you want help securing or remotely accessing it.

## 🟡 Lightweight Alternative: Glances (Web Mode)

For a simpler but less visual experience:

### Install:

```bash
sudo apt install glances
```

### Run Web Interface:

```bash
glances -w
```

### Access:

```
http://<your-pi-ip>:61208
```

Uses less CPU/RAM than Netdata, good for resource-constrained Pis.

---

## ⚙️ Bonus: Enable Autostart on Boot (Optional)

To make Netdata start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable netdata
```

For Glances (web mode), you’d need to set up a systemd service. Ask if you want help with that.
