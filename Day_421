### ðŸ’¾ Cloud storage example

| Service           | Monthly Fee | 3 Years | 5 Years |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| iCloud+ (2 TB)    | $9.99       | $360    | $600    |
| Google One (2 TB) | $9.99       | $360    | $600    |
| Dropbox Plus      | $11.99      | $432    | $720    |

â†’ A single cloud subscription alone can cost **$360â€“$720** over 3â€“5 years â€” and you still donâ€™t own the storage hardware.

### ðŸŽµ Streaming & software

If we include other digital subscriptions:

* Netflix (~$15/mo): $540 over 3 years
* Spotify (~$11/mo): $396 over 3 years
* Microsoft 365 (~$70/yr): $210 over 3 years

Total for typical households:
**$600â€“$1,500 (or more)** over 3â€“5 years is quite realistic â€” and thatâ€™s just for access, not ownership.

âœ… **Verdict:**
Yes, **the statement is generally true** â€” itâ€™s an accurate economic observation about how subscription-based digital ecosystems (like cloud storage and streaming) can add up over a few years without providing ownership of the underlying hardware or data infrastructure.
