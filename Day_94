To determine whether this investment is profitable **after adjusting for inflation**, weâ€™ll follow these steps:

---

### ðŸ“Œ Basic Data:

* **Annual Investment:** â‚¹100,000
* **Duration:** 10 years
* **Total Invested:** â‚¹1,000,000 (â‚¹100,000 Ã— 10)
* **Return After 10 Years:** â‚¹2,515,500

### ðŸ§® Step-by-Step Profitability Check (with Inflation Adjustment)

Weâ€™ll use **Net Present Value (NPV)** to adjust for inflation. Youâ€™ll need to specify the **average annual inflation rate**â€”a common estimate is **6% per year** (can vary by country).

### ðŸŽ¯ NPV Formula:

We discount each â‚¹100,000 annual payment and the â‚¹2,515,500 final return back to todayâ€™s value.

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{-100,000}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{2,515,500}{(1 + r)^{10}}
$$

Where **r = inflation rate** (e.g., 6% or 0.06)

### âœ… Using 6% Inflation:

1. **Present Value of Outflows (investments):**

   $$
   PV_{\text{investments}} = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{100,000}{(1.06)^t} \approx 790,787
   $$

2. **Present Value of Inflow (final return):**

   $$
   PV_{\text{return}} = \frac{2,515,500}{(1.06)^{10}} \approx 1,401,220
   $$

3. **NPV = PV of inflow â€“ PV of outflows:**

   $$
   \text{NPV} = 1,401,220 - 790,787 = \boxed{â‚¹610,433}
   $$

### âœ… Conclusion:

Yes, the investment is **profitable** after adjusting for **6% inflation** â€” with a **real gain of \~â‚¹610,000** in today's money. The **inflation-adjusted return** is solid, assuming no hidden risks, taxes, or fees.
