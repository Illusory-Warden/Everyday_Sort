### ðŸ”¹ **TCO**

**Full form:** *Total Cost of Ownership*

**Meaning:**
TCO represents the **complete cost of owning and operating** something (like hardware, software, or infrastructure) over its lifetime â€” not just the purchase price.

**Includes:**

* Initial purchase or setup cost
* Maintenance and support
* Upgrades or replacements
* Energy consumption
* Staff/labor/training costs

**Example:**
When comparing cloud storage vs. a self-hosted NAS, TCO would include not only hardware costs but also electricity, time spent maintaining servers, and subscription fees.

### ðŸ”¹ **LUKS**

**Full form:** *Linux Unified Key Setup*

**Meaning:**
LUKS is a **disk encryption standard** used on Linux systems. It protects data on storage devices by encrypting entire block devices (like hard drives or partitions).

**Key Points:**

* Provides strong encryption (often AES-based).
* Supports multiple user passphrases.
* Commonly used with tools like `cryptsetup`.
* Ensures data confidentiality if the drive is stolen or lost.

**Example:**
You might encrypt a Raspberry Piâ€™s external drive using LUKS to keep all stored files secure.
