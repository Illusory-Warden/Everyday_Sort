### 💼 Delivery (CNC) Orders on Groww

* When you buy in **delivery**, the shares are actually delivered to your **Demat account**.
* You officially *own* them — there’s **no time limit** on when you can sell.
* Whether you sell it the same day, next day, or after months — **no penalty** or fine applies.

---

### ⚠️ Only Be Careful About:

1. **Same-day buy and sell (intraday)**:

   * If you intended *delivery* but sell the same day, Groww still charges **no penalty**, but it’ll be treated as **delivery + sell** (not intraday).
   * Brokerage is still ₹0 for delivery, so no worries.

2. **T+1 settlement**:

   * You can sell your delivery shares only **after they’re credited** to your Demat account (usually the next day under T+1 settlement).

3. **Taxes on profits**:

   * If you make short-term profits (less than 1 year holding), **STCG tax (15%)** applies when you file your income tax return.
   * This is not charged immediately by Groww, but by the **Income Tax Department** when you report gains.

✅ **Summary:**

> No penalties. You can freely buy a stock in delivery and sell it in 2–3 days.
> Just pay small exchange/government charges — no hidden Groww fees.
