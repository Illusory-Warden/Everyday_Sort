### ✅ What the official sources say

* A press release states that the platform “is also used as an avenue … to offer internships.” ([Business Standard][1])
* Specifically: “The TECHgium® platform is also used as an avenue … to offer internships.” ([Business Standard][1])
* The same release mentions that the winning teams may get a “continuation of work on the PoCs of interest, pre-placement offer and recognition”. ([Business Standard][1])

### ⚠️ What you must check / clarify

* While internships are *mentioned*, the announcement (that you shared) does *not explicitly guarantee* that **every participant** will receive an internship. It says “used as an avenue” which suggests opportunities, not a commitment for all.
* It’s not clear exactly **how** the internships are allocated: e.g., whether they are for only the winning teams, or for certain teams/projects, or whether an internship depends on selection by LTTS.
* You should check if there are any extra eligibility criteria for the internship portion (for example: team has to reach a certain stage, or LTTS selects them further).
* It may also be wise to contact your CDC or the organisers via the TECHgium portal/support to ask: “If our team is selected (or wins) will we be offered an internship? What are the terms (duration, stipend, location)?”

### 🎯 My suggestion for you (Rushi)

Since you’re at St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology and this applies to your batch (2026 & 2027), I recommend you do this:

* Highlight in your team’s abstract and idea how you are keen on **industry-application**, **project continuation**, and **real-world impact**, because this kind of mindset may increase your chances of being shortlisted for the internship benefit.
* While forming your team or submitting, check the terms & conditions of TECHgium (sometimes available on their portal) to see if internship clauses are listed.
* If you get shortlisted or win, ask the organisers (via email) about how the internship offer works (duration, scope, stipend, location, remote/onsite, etc).
