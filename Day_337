An **access token** is like a **digital key** that proves you’re allowed to use an API or a service.

### 🔑 How it works

* When you **sign up / log in** to an API service, the server gives you an **access token**.
* You send this token along with each API request.
* The server checks:

  * If the token is valid
  * If it hasn’t expired
  * If you have permission to access the resource
* If all good → you get the data.
* If not → you get errors like **401 Unauthorized**.

### 🔐 Example

Suppose you’re using an API that requires Bearer tokens.

* The service gives you:

  ```
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
  ```
* You add it in the HTTP headers:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
  ```

Now, every request has proof that you’re authenticated.

### 📌 Access token vs API key

* **API key**: usually static, a simple string you paste into your request.
* **Access token**: often temporary (expires after minutes or hours), you must refresh it using a login or refresh token process.
