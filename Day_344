Nice — getting the API key is quick. Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide to obtain a **free OpenWeather API key** and how to use it safely in your n8n HTTP Request node.

---

# 1) Get the key from OpenWeather

1. Go to **openweathermap.org** and click **Sign up / Create account**.
2. Verify your email (they’ll send a confirmation).
3. Log in and open your account dashboard (usually under your profile menu).
4. Find the **API keys** or **API keys management** section.
5. Click **Create / Generate API key** (give it a name like `n8n-weather`).
6. Copy the generated key (a long string). That’s your `YOUR_API_KEY`.

> Tip: The free plan is fine for hobby usage, but it has call limits — avoid making thousands of requests per minute.

# 2) Use the key in your n8n **HTTP Request** node

You have two safe/simple options:

**A — Put the key in the URL (quick & simple)**

* URL:

```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you copied.

**B — Better: use the HTTP Request node’s Query Parameters**

1. In the HTTP Request node set:

   * **Method:** `GET`
   * **URL:** `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
2. In the node’s **Query Parameters** section add:

   * Key: `q` → Value: `London` (or your city)
   * Key: `appid` → Value: `YOUR_API_KEY`
   * Key: `units` → Value: `metric`
3. This separates parameters from the URL and is easier to read/manage.

# 3) Make the key more secure (recommended)

* **Don’t paste the key into public workflows** or share the JSON with the key inside.
* For improved security, store the key outside of node text:

  * Put it into n8n **Credentials** or into your server’s **environment variables** and reference it in the node via an expression.
  * Example: if you store the key as an environment variable `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, in the **appid** query value you could use an expression to pull it in (so your workflow JSON doesn’t contain the plain key).
  * Exact expression syntax may vary with your n8n version, but the idea is to avoid hardcoding secrets.

---

# 4) Quick checklist after you have the key

* [ ] Confirm email verification completed.
* [ ] Copy key and test one request in n8n HTTP Request node.
* [ ] Verify the response comes back JSON with `main.temp`, `weather[0].description`, etc.
* [ ] Move key to credentials/env variable if you plan to share the workflow.

Want me to show the exact Query Parameter setup inside the HTTP Request node (field names + example values) so you can paste it into n8n?
