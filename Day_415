### ðŸŽ¤ **Speech for EN-MUN â€” Representing Manohar Lal Khattar (Chief Minister of Haryana)**

**Honourable Chair, distinguished delegates, and respected members of the house,**

Good morning to all.

It is a privilege to address this esteemed gathering as a representative of **Haryana**, a state that stands tall on the pillars of development, inclusivity, and progress. I, **Manohar Lal Khattar**, have always believed that leadership is not about power, but about purpose â€” and that purpose is *service to the people*.

Over the past decade, Haryana has transformed into a model of governance that prioritizes **transparency, accountability, and efficiency**. We have implemented digital reforms to ensure that every rupee spent reaches the rightful beneficiary. From e-governance to paperless offices, we are redefining public administration for a modern India.

But governance is not just about infrastructure â€” it is about people.
In a society as diverse as ours, **social harmony** is the foundation of strength. We have consistently worked to promote peace and understanding among communities. I firmly believe that unity in diversity is not a slogan â€” it is the spirit that binds our nation together.

Another key focus of our government has been **women empowerment**. When I first assumed office, Haryana faced one of the lowest sex ratios in the country. Today, through initiatives like *Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao*, awareness campaigns, and stringent law enforcement, we have changed that narrative. The daughters of Haryana are excelling in academics, sports, and administration â€” they are our pride and our power.

At the same time, **youth empowerment** has remained close to my heart. The youth are not just the future â€” they are the present. We have established skill development centers, startup incubators, and employment programs so that every young person can contribute to the nationâ€™s progress. My message to the youth is simple: *Dream big, work hard, and serve selflessly.*

In our pursuit of growth, we also focus on **sustainable development**. Haryanaâ€™s initiatives in renewable energy, afforestation, and water conservation aim to build an environmentally conscious state. Development and environment must go hand in hand â€” for what we take from nature today, we owe to our children tomorrow.

Lastly, I would like to emphasize the importance of **international cooperation and cultural exchange**. Whether it was delivering speeches in Tamil, Japanese, or Russian, my intent has always been to bridge gaps â€” because when we speak in each otherâ€™s language, we speak to each otherâ€™s hearts. Indiaâ€™s message to the world is one of friendship, peace, and progress.

**In conclusion**, I stand before you with conviction that leadership is not defined by titles, but by actions â€” and that true progress is achieved when governance touches every life with dignity and equality.

Let us work together â€” as citizens, as leaders, as nations â€” to create a world that is just, sustainable, and united by humanity.

**Thank you. Jai Hind.**
