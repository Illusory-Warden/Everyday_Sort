# If Lovable was authorized as an **OAuth App**

1. Go to GitHub and sign in.
2. Click your profile photo → **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar choose **Applications** → **Authorized OAuth Apps**.
4. Find **Lovable** in the list, click it, then click **Revoke access**.

   * This immediately removes Lovable’s access tokens and it can no longer access your account/repos.

# If Lovable was installed as a **GitHub App**

1. Profile photo → **Settings** → **Applications** → **Authorized GitHub Apps** (or go to **Installed GitHub Apps**).
2. Find **Lovable**, click **Configure** (or the app entry) and choose **Uninstall** or **Revoke**.

   * Uninstalling a GitHub App also removes its access to repositories and webhooks.

# If the authorization was given to an **organization** (you’re an org member or owner)

* **Org owner**: Organization → **Settings** → **Third-party access** or **OAuth Apps** (exact label varies) → find **Lovable** → **Revoke** / **Remove**.
* If you’re not an owner, ask an org owner to remove the app.

# Optional: Revoke via GitHub API (advanced)

If you prefer CLI/API and have the app’s `client_id` and your access token, there are API endpoints to revoke grants/tokens — but that requires credentials and is more advanced. If you want this, tell me and I’ll give exact curl commands.

# After revocation (recommended)

* Check your repo settings / webhooks to ensure no leftover webhooks or integrations remain.
* If Lovable provided any OAuth tokens to you (or you generated PATs for it), delete those tokens on the Lovable side if possible.
