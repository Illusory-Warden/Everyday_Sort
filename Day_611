Title: Creating Threads in Java
Left Side: Extending Thread Class

• Create a class that extends Thread
• Override the run() method
• Call start() to begin execution

Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
t1.start();

Right Side: Implementing Runnable Interface

• Create a class that implements Runnable
• Override the run() method
• Pass object to Thread constructor
• Call start() method

Example:

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyTask());
t1.start();


Bottom Highlight Line:

Implementing Runnable is generally preferred because Java supports single inheritance.
