✅ **Correct answers:**

* **IPv6 addresses are represented by hexadecimal numbers.**
* **IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length.**

---

### ✔️ Explanation of Correct Statements:

1. **✅ IPv6 addresses are represented by hexadecimal numbers**

   * IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, displayed as **eight groups of four hexadecimal digits** (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`).

2. **✅ IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length**

   * IPv4 uses **32-bit** addresses, typically written in **dotted decimal** format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

### ❌ Explanation of Incorrect Statements:

* **IPv4 addresses are represented by hexadecimal numbers**

  * ✘ IPv4 uses **decimal** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`), **not hexadecimal**.

* **IPv6 addresses are 32 bits in length**

  * ✘ IPv6 is **128 bits**, not 32.

* **IPv4 addresses are 128 bits in length**

  * ✘ IPv4 is only **32 bits** long.

* **IPv6 addresses are 64 bits in length**

  * ✘ IPv6 is **128 bits**. Sometimes the **interface identifier** is 64 bits, but the full address is **128**.

### ✅ Summary:

The two correct statements are:

* **IPv6 addresses are represented by hexadecimal numbers.**
* **IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length.**
