### 🏫 **What the message means:**

* TECHgium uses its **own internal “Institute Code”** (different from your DTE or university code).
* This internal code is only generated **after the college officially registers** itself on the TECHgium portal.
* Since you’re seeing this message, it means **St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering & Technology, Nagpur** has **not yet been registered** on the TECHgium portal by the college authorities.

---

### ⚙️ **What you (students) should do:**

You **can’t generate or fill that code yourself**.
You need to **contact your college’s CDC or Training & Placement Cell (TPO)** and tell them:

> “While registering for TECHgium on the LTTS portal, it says our college is not registered and that an institute code is required. Can the college please register on the TECHgium portal so that we can complete our registration before the deadline (24th October, 11:59 PM)?”

---

### 📞 **Who to contact:**

* **Team CDC** (Career Development Centre) of your college — they usually handle L&T / placement registrations.
* Or directly your **Placement Officer / Dean of CDC**.
* They will have to **register the college once** on the TECHgium site; after that, the system will automatically generate and send the **unique institute code** to them.

---

### 🚨 **Important:**

Do this **as soon as possible** (today itself) because the **deadline for abstract submission is tonight, 24th October 2025, 11:59 PM**.
The registration won’t go through until the college is added by L&T Techgium.
