📚 Complete Summary of Our Chat — MariaDB Setup + GUI on Parrot OS
🧱 1. Installed MariaDB on Parrot OS
We used the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server
This installed the MariaDB server, which is a drop-in replacement for MySQL (fully compatible).

🔐 2. Secured the MariaDB Installation
We ran:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mysql_secure_installation
During the prompts:

Disabled Unix Socket Authentication: N

Removed Anonymous Users: Y

Disabled Remote Root Login: Y

Removed Test Database: Y

Reloaded privilege tables: Y

This step helped lock down the database to prevent security issues.

💡 3. Checked and Started MariaDB Service
Verified if MariaDB is running:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl status mariadb
If needed, we started it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start mariadb
And optionally enabled it to start on boot:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
🖥️ 4. Logged into MariaDB
Used this command to enter the MariaDB shell:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mysql
Prompt looked like this:

nginx
Copy
Edit
MariaDB [(none)]>
This means it’s ready to use!

📦 5. Downloaded & Extracted a Sample Database
You downloaded mysqlsampledatabase.zip from MySQL Tutorial’s website.

Right-clicked it → chose "Extract to" → selected your DBMS folder.

Inside it was mysqlsampledatabase.sql.

🛠️ 6. Imported the Sample Database
First, created a new database:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE sample;
exit;
Then imported the .sql file into that DB:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/Desktop/DBMS
sudo mysql sample < mysqlsampledatabase.sql
✅ This loaded the tables and data into MariaDB.

🧰 7. Installed MySQL Workbench (GUI Tool)
First installed Snap (if not already):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install snapd
Then installed Workbench via Snap:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo snap install mysql-workbench-community
🖱️ 8. Opened MySQL Workbench
You can open the GUI:

By running:

bash
Copy
Edit
mysql-workbench-community
Or from the Application Menu

Optionally, created a desktop shortcut

🔗 9. Connected Workbench to Local MariaDB
Created a new connection:

Host: localhost

Port: 3306

Username: root

Password: (blank if you didn’t set one)

Clicked Test Connection

Saved and connected ✅

🔍 10. Explored Some SQL Basics (you asked briefly)
