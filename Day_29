IMEI tracking is a highly sensitive and tightly regulated topic, both ethically and legally. Here's a breakdown of what you can and cannot do in Parrot OS (or any Linux-based system) regarding IMEI numbers and phone tracking:

üîê What is an IMEI Number?
IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique 15-digit identifier assigned to mobile devices.

It‚Äôs used by mobile networks to identify valid devices and can be used to block stolen phones from accessing the network.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Legal Disclaimer
Tracking a phone using its IMEI without explicit permission from the user or proper legal authority (like law enforcement) is illegal in most countries. Tools capable of doing so are often restricted or considered black-hat.

‚úÖ What You Can Do on Parrot OS (Legally & Ethically)
Parrot OS (a security-focused Linux distro) offers tools for network analysis, pen-testing, and digital forensics, not direct IMEI-based tracking. However, you can use tools in combination with legal cooperation from carriers or for your own devices (e.g., anti-theft tools).

üì° Tools & Techniques in Parrot OS (Not Direct IMEI Trackers)
Here are tools that are used for general mobile/network forensics, but do NOT directly track IMEI locations unless integrated with GSM networks:

1. Osmocom Projects (like osmocom-bb)
Used to communicate with GSM modems.

You can capture and analyze GSM traffic.

May extract IMEI from GSM handshake if you have a compatible SDR (e.g., HackRF, RTL-SDR).

2. GR-GSM
Works with SDR devices to sniff GSM traffic.

Can be used to analyze traffic and potentially extract metadata like IMEI numbers.

3. Wireshark
Packet analyzer that can work with GSM captures.

You can inspect IMEI numbers if they are transmitted unencrypted (rare today).

4. Kali‚Äôs Snoopy-ng (can also be installed on Parrot)
A framework for tracking devices via Wi-Fi probe requests.

Doesn‚Äôt use IMEI but can fingerprint and track phones over time via MAC addresses.

5. OpenBTS + Asterisk
Can simulate a GSM base station.

Ethically used for research and testing.

You could capture IMEI numbers from devices connecting to your tower (again, only if you own those devices).

‚ùå What You CANNOT Do (Without Breaking the Law)
Track someone‚Äôs live location via IMEI using open-source tools alone.

Get IMEI info from mobile networks without telecom provider access.

Run tools that actively track phones via IMEI without consent.

üëÆ If You Lost Your Phone
You can:

Report the IMEI to your carrier.

Use services like:

Google Find My Device

Samsung Find My Mobile

Or local police with the IMEI number.


===========================================================================================================================================================================================

üß† PART 1: What is IMEI and How Is It Used in Tracking?
üìå IMEI Basics:
IMEI = International Mobile Equipment Identity (15-digit code).

Tied to the physical hardware (not SIM card).

Stored in:

Baseband firmware

Phone settings

Sent during GSM registration to the cell tower.

üì° PART 2: How Phones Reveal Their IMEI
When a phone connects to a GSM network, it performs:

Location Update Request ‚Üí tells the tower it's online

IMEI Transmission ‚Üí phone may send IMEI in clear text

TMSI/IMSI Allocation ‚Üí temporary subscriber IDs used later

Note: 4G and 5G networks encrypt more metadata. IMEI leakage is rare there unless devices fall back to 2G/GSM.

üß∞ PART 3: Tools in Parrot OS for IMEI/GSM Exploration
üß™ 1. GR-GSM
Purpose: Capture GSM traffic and analyze it.

Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install gr-gsm
Hardware needed: SDR like RTL-SDR, HackRF.

Process:

Tune to GSM frequency (e.g., 900 MHz).

Capture bursts using airprobe or grgsm_livemon.

Analyze with Wireshark using grgsm decoder.

You can sometimes catch IMEI, IMSI, TMSI, and call/SMS metadata‚Äîonly on 2G unencrypted networks.

üõ∞ 2. Osmocom (Osmocom-BB)
Purpose: Open-source GSM stack. Can be used to emulate or intercept baseband behavior.

Use with:

Old Motorola C118/C123 phones (with special cable + patched firmware)

Or integrate with SDR setups

Components:

layer1, mobile, ccch_scan ‚Äì for capturing control channels

What you can get:

IMEI from phones connecting to your base station

Silent SMS messages (in lab environments)

üèó 3. OpenBTS + Asterisk
Purpose: Simulate your own GSM tower (experimental).

Combine:

OpenBTS (GSM stack)

Asterisk (PBX system for calls/SMS)

USRP / LimeSDR / HackRF (radio)

Use case:

Phones in range connect thinking it‚Äôs a real tower.

You can log IMEIs, calls, and SMS.

Great for training, capture the flag, testbeds.

‚ö†Ô∏è Highly regulated. Use in a Faraday cage or shielded lab only.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 4. Wireshark with GSM Plugins
Once you capture traffic using grgsm_capture, load the .cfile in Wireshark.

You can filter:

wireshark
Copy
Edit
gsm_a.rr.imei
üìç PART 4: Can You Track a Phone Live by IMEI?
Short answer: No, not directly using open-source tools.

You‚Äôd need:
Access to carrier-level data (they triangulate location via cell towers).

A fake base station that can lure the phone and extract the IMEI (very illegal in public).

Legal tools like SS7 access or law enforcement cooperation.

‚úÖ LEGAL USES (And Fun Projects You Can Try)
üì± Personal Tracking
Register your IMEI with your carrier to block it if lost.

Use Find My iPhone or Find My Device for GPS-based tracking (needs Internet).

üß™ Research & Learning
Set up a local GSM lab to:

Understand how 2G works.

Practice IMEI/IMSI catching.

Learn cellular forensics.

üìÇ Forensics Tools (Optional extras)
Cellebrite, Magnet AXIOM, Autopsy (not IMEI-specific, but do mobile data extraction)

Androguard, MobSF ‚Äì for app & malware forensics.

üîß Sample Setup to Start Capturing GSM Traffic
bash code

# 1. Install GR-GSM
sudo apt install gr-gsm

# 2. Run Live Monitor with SDR
grgsm_livemon

# 3. Open Wireshark on loopback interface
# 4. Filter with: gsm_a.rr.imei or gsm_a.dtap

# 5. Decode captured traffic for analysis
‚ö†Ô∏è Final Advice
If you're building this for educational reasons, keep it:

In a lab or shielded room üõ°Ô∏è

On your own devices üì±

Never in public spaces ‚ùå

Tracking people via IMEI without consent = major privacy crime in many countries.
