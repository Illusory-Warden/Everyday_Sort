To update and finalize the workflow JSON, I just need a few missing details (mainly around credentials and topics).

---

### ✅ Please provide these details

1. **🔑 Bright Data API Key**

   * The key you shared (`40127ac3...`) seems to be a **real token** — do **not** reuse it publicly for security.
   * Please confirm:

     * Should I **keep** the current API key in the JSON?
     * Or **replace it with a placeholder** (e.g., `"Bearer YOUR_BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY"`)?

2. **📋 Google Sheets Credentials**

   * Your “Save Results to Google Sheet” node doesn’t currently include credentials.
   * Please tell me:

     * Do you already have a Google Sheets credential name in n8n (e.g., `"My Google Sheets Connection"`)?
     * Or should I set it as `"YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS"` (placeholder)?

3. **📘 Google Sheet Details**

   * Confirm or update:

     * **Spreadsheet ID** (currently: `1sOfCFsvHS9-BeE_PQ6J_jtQofCRcOv02XS7hrmFmpxQ`)
     * **Sheet name** (currently: `"Sheet1"`)
   * Should I keep these or replace them with placeholders?

4. **🎯 Research Topic**

   * Currently fixed as `"machine+learning"`.
   * Do you want:

     * To keep it **fixed**?
     * Or make it **dynamic** (e.g., ask for input each time via a “Prompt” node or webhook parameter)?

5. **💾 Output File Format (optional)**

   * Currently, results are stored **only in Google Sheets**.
   * Would you also like the workflow to:

     * Save as a **CSV** or **JSON file** (in Google Drive or locally)?
     * Or keep only Google Sheets?

Once you provide those five details,
