✅ Things to verify after turning your RPi back on:
Docker is running: Make sure the Docker daemon started properly:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl status docker
Twingate container is running: Check your running containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
You should see your Twingate container there. If not, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker start <container_name_or_id>
Container was set with restart policy: When you created your Twingate container, if you used:

bash
Copy
Edit
--restart=always
Then it should automatically start with your RPi on boot.

Network connectivity:

Check that your RPi has an internet connection.

Make sure no firewall or DNS issue is blocking Twingate from connecting.

Twingate admin console: You can log into your Twingate admin console and confirm that your connector shows as "Connected" or "Online".

❌ When you'd need to reconfigure:
If you deleted the Twingate Docker container and didn't use persistent storage/volumes.

If the tokens expired and you didn't store them in a volume or ENV.

If there were manual changes in OMV that affected Docker or networking setup.
