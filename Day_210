When you export, **you choose the export location** â€” DBeaver does **not** store exports automatically.

#### âœ… To Find Previous Export Locations:

1. Click on the **`Downloads` tab** at the bottom (as seen in your screenshot).
2. Or check these default folders:

   * **\~/Downloads/**
   * Or the custom folder you chose during export
