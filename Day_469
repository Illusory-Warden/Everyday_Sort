1. Make sure youâ€™re still inside the project folder:

   ```
   C::\Users\Invoice\simple-invoice
   ```
2. Run this:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
3. Wait a few seconds â€” youâ€™ll see something like:

   ```
   App running at:
     - Local: http://localhost:3000/
   ```
4. Open that address in your browser (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
