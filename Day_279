I understand your concern. Let me break it down clearly:

### 1. **What “negative number specs” mean**

* Negative power lenses (like -1.00, -2.00, etc.) are for **myopia (nearsightedness)**.
* They help you see distant objects clearly by *diverging* light before it enters your eyes.
* These lenses do **not magnify**—in fact, they make things look slightly smaller.

### 2. **Why your glasses now feel like a “magnifying glass”**

If your glasses suddenly feel “too strong” (objects seem distorted, magnified, or uncomfortable):

* Your **eyesight may have changed** (either improved or worsened).
* Sometimes, **prolonged use of an outdated prescription** can make your vision feel “off.”
* If your eyes improved (rare but possible in mild myopia, especially in young adults), your current specs may now be “overpowering.”
* More commonly, your **myopia might have increased**, and your brain is struggling to adjust, making it feel like the lenses are distorting.
* Another possibility is **lens wear/warping, scratches, or coating damage** in the specs, which can distort vision.

### 3. **Do eyes really “repair” themselves?**

* **True reversal of myopia is uncommon.** Glasses don’t make eyes worse or better—they just correct focus.
* However, lifestyle factors (like less screen time, more outdoor time, proper lighting) can slow or stabilize myopia progression.
* Sometimes after long daily use, your brain adapts, so when vision changes even a little, your old specs feel strange.

### 4. **What you should do now**

* **Get an eye checkup** (refraction test). Only this can confirm if your number decreased, increased, or stayed the same.
* If your number reduced (less negative), your current specs will feel too strong → causing magnification or strain.
* If your number increased (more negative), you’ll find distance vision blurrier without glasses.
