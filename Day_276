The public interface shows you the "type of data" you're *allowed to give* and *will get back*, but it hides the specific technical details of how that data is stored *inside* the object.

### Simple Example:

Imagine a `BankAccount` class.

**Public Interface (What you see):**
*   `getBalance()` returns a **`double`** (e.g., `250.75`)
*   `deposit(int dollars)` accepts an **`int`** (e.g., `10` for $10)

**Private Implementation (The Secret):**
The class might not store the balance as a `double` at all! It could store it as an **`int`** representing the total number of **pennies** (cents) to avoid rounding errors.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // SECRET IMPLEMENTATION: The "type" of the field is HIDDEN
    private int balanceInCents; // Type is 'int', not 'double'!

    // PUBLIC INTERFACE: The method signatures define the "types" you work with
    public double getBalance() { // I promise to return a 'double'
        // Secret Conversion: int -> double
        return balanceInCents / 100.0;
    }

    public void deposit(int dollars) { // I ask you for an 'int'
        // Secret Conversion: int -> int
        balanceInCents += (dollars * 100);
    }
}
```

### What "Type" Means Here:

*   **You** interact with types **`double`** and **`int`** (the public interface).
*   The **object** internally uses a field of type **`int`** (the private implementation).

The getter/setter **signatures** are part of the public interface because they advertise these types (`double getBalance()`, `void deposit(int)`). But the actual **type of the field** (`private int balanceInCents`) is a hidden implementation detail.

**In short:** "Type" means the specific primitive or class (like `int`, `double`, `String`) used for the field. The public interface doesn't reveal if the internal type matches the external type. It's part of the secret.
