Analysis of Code and Algorithm

Approach: Bottom-up Dynamic Programming.

Optimal Substructure: Each subproblem’s optimal solution contributes to the global optimal solution.

Overlapping Subproblems: Subproblems are reused, avoiding redundant computation.

Time Complexity:

O(nW), where n = number of items, and W = knapsack capacity.

Space Complexity:

O(nW), due to the 2D DP table.

Can be optimized to O(W) using a 1D array (space optimization).

Efficiency Discussion:

Efficient for moderate values of W.

For very large W, the pseudo-polynomial time can be a limitation.
