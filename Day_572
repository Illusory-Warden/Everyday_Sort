Tavily API only accepts this parameter:

```
include_raw_content = true | false | "markdown" | "text"
```

But your HTTP Request node is sending **something else** (usually `"yes"`, `"full"`, `1`, `"true"` as string, or empty).

So Tavily rejects the entire request.

# ✅ Fix (exact settings)

Open your **Tavily API (HTTP Request) node** in n8n.

### Set it like this:

### METHOD

```
POST
```

### URL

```
https://api.tavily.com/search
```

---

### HEADERS

| Name          | Value                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Content-Type  | application/json           |
| Authorization | Bearer YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY |

---

### BODY → JSON

Use **exactly this**:

```json
{
  "query": "latest AI research papers",
  "search_depth": "advanced",
  "max_results": 5,
  "include_raw_content": "markdown"
}
```

⚠️ IMPORTANT:

* `include_raw_content` must be **markdown** or **text** or true/false
* Do NOT send numbers or yes/no strings

# Common Mistake

These ❌ will break Tavily:

```
"include_raw_content": "full"
"include_raw_content": "yes"
"include_raw_content": 1
"include_raw_content": "true"
```

These ✅ are valid:

```
"include_raw_content": true
"include_raw_content": false
"include_raw_content": "markdown"
"include_raw_content": "text"
```

---

# After you fix this

Your Tavily node will return:

* full page content
* clean markdown/text
* ready for LLM ingestion
