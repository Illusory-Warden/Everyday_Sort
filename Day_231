### 🔹 Slide 1 – Title Slide

📌 Title: "The Impossible Light"
📌 Subtitle: “A Declassified Report on the Blue LED Discovery (1965–1993)”
📌 Content:

* Group name and team members
* Vintage lab image or sketch of an LED
  🖼️ Style: Sepia-toned background, typewriter font, old paper texture

---

### 🔹 Slide 2 – Why This Story Matters

📌 Title: “A Missing Color in the Light Spectrum”
📌 Content:

* Red and green LEDs existed
* But without blue, white light wasn't possible
* Hook: “No blue LED = no smartphones, Blu-ray, white LEDs”
  🖼️ Style: Chalkboard or old projector slide with bold fact and faded headline

---

### 🔹 Slide 3 – A Little History

📌 Title: “The LED Timeline Before Blue”
📌 Content:

* Red LED: 1962
* Green LED: 1970
* Early blue LED attempt: RCA, 1972 (Herbert Maruska) — dim & impractical
  🖼️ Style: Timeline sketch with old date stamps or lab report formatting

---

### 🔹 Slide 4 – The Scientific Wall

📌 Title: “Why Blue Was Almost Impossible”
📌 Content:

* GaN is tough to grow
* p-type doping didn't work (Hydrogen passivation issue)
* No good substrates = poor crystal quality
  🖼️ Style: Blueprint background with hand-drawn atom lattice or GaN cross-section

---

### 🔹 Slide 5 – Meet the Pioneers

📌 Title: “The Scientists Who Defied the Odds”
📌 Content:

* Isamu Akasaki & Hiroshi Amano (Nagoya University)
* Shuji Nakamura (Nichia Corporation)
* Each solved part of the problem (buffer layer, doping, brightness)
  🖼️ Style: Old black-and-white photos with paperclip icons and handwritten names

---

### 🔹 Slide 6 – The Breakthrough

📌 Title: “Cracking the Code of GaN”
📌 Content:

* Use of low-temperature buffer layers
* Mg-doping + annealing to activate p-type conductivity
* InGaN quantum well = high brightness blue LED
  🖼️ Style: Retro patent-style sketch of LED layer structure

---

### 🔹 Slide 7 – Blueprint of a Blue LED

📌 Title: “Anatomy of the Impossible”
📌 Content:

* Diagram: Substrate → Buffer → n-GaN → InGaN QW → p-GaN → Contact
* Each part labeled like a 90s engineering schematic
  🖼️ Style: Technical drawing background with blueprint lines & grid

---

### 🔹 Slide 8 – The World Reacts

📌 Title: “From Lab Secret to Nobel Spotlight”
📌 Content:

* Nobel Prize in Physics, 2014
* Blue LED completed the RGB trio → white light possible
* Massive impact: Energy savings, digital displays, LEDs everywhere
  🖼️ Style: Old newspaper layout or mock Nobel press release

---

### 🔹 Slide 9 – Fun Facts & What If It Never Happened?

📌 Title: “Tech That Wouldn’t Exist Without It”
📌 Content:

* LED TVs, smartphones, Blu-ray, traffic lights, LED bulbs
* "What if blue LEDs had never been invented?"
* Quiz question: “How long did it take to make the blue LED?” (30 years)
  🖼️ Style: Vintage trivia card or classroom chalkboard quiz style

---

### 🔹 Slide 10 – Conclusion + Q\&A

📌 Title: “Archived and Acknowledged”
📌 Content:

* Recap: Solving blue was the final puzzle piece
* Legacy: Brighter, cleaner world
* Invite questions
  🖼️ Style: “CONFIDENTIAL” stamp, manila folder design, old signature fonts
