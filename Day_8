### 🔐 **Qubes OS: A Security-Focused Operating System**  

**Qubes OS** is a security-centric operating system designed to provide strong isolation for different tasks and applications. It uses **Xen-based virtualization** to compartmentalize different parts of the system into **qubes (isolated virtual machines)**, preventing malware or security breaches from affecting the entire system.

## 🛡 **Key Features of Qubes OS**  

### 1️⃣ **Security Through Isolation**  
- Every application or task runs in its own **qube (virtual machine)**.  
- If one qube gets compromised, the rest of the system remains secure.  

### 2️⃣ **Multiple Types of Qubes**  
- **App Qubes** – For running everyday applications (e.g., web browser, email client).  
- **Network Qubes** – Handles all networking to keep it separate from applications.  
- **USB Qubes** – Isolates USB devices to prevent firmware attacks.  
- **Vault Qubes** – Keeps sensitive data like passwords and encryption keys.  

### 3️⃣ **Color-Coded Window Borders**  
- Qubes OS assigns different security levels to each window, using **color-coded borders** to visually distinguish them.  
  - 🔴 **Red** – Untrusted (e.g., a random downloaded file).  
  - 🟡 **Yellow** – Less trusted (e.g., personal browsing).  
  - 🟢 **Green** – More trusted (e.g., work-related).  
  - 🔵 **Blue** – Highly trusted (e.g., password manager).  

### 4️⃣ **Privacy & Anonymity Features**  
- **Built-in Tor support** via **Whonix integration** for anonymous browsing.  
- **Disposable VMs** – Temporary qubes that disappear after closing (great for opening suspicious files).  

### 5️⃣ **Template-Based System for Efficiency**  
- Instead of installing software in every qube, **template qubes** allow shared software installations, making updates more efficient.
