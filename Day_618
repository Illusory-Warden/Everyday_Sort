**SSO (Single Sign-On)** is an authentication system that lets you **log in once and access multiple applications without signing in again**.

---

## 🧠 Simple idea

Instead of:

* Login to Gmail
* Login to YouTube
* Login to Drive

👉 With SSO:

* Login **once**
* Access all services automatically

---

## 🔐 How it works (concept)

There are three main parts:

1. **User** — you
2. **Identity Provider (IdP)** — the login authority
3. **Applications (Service Providers)** — apps you want to use

### Flow

```text
You → App → redirected to SSO login → authenticated → access granted
```

The IdP gives the app a **token** proving you are authenticated.

## 🧩 Real-world examples you already use

### Google ecosystem

When you log into:

* Gmail
* YouTube
* Google Drive

👉 That’s Google SSO in action.

You logged in once, but many apps trust Google.

---

### “Login with Google / GitHub / Facebook”

When websites show:

* Continue with Google
* Sign in with GitHub

👉 That is SSO using OAuth/OIDC.

---

## 🏢 Where SSO is used

### 1️⃣ Companies (VERY common)

Employees log in once and access:

* email
* VPN
* internal dashboards
* HR systems
* cloud apps

**Why companies love it:**

* fewer passwords
* easier user management
* better security
* faster onboarding/offboarding

---

### 2️⃣ Universities

Students log in once to access:

* student portal
* library
* LMS
* email

---

### 3️⃣ Cloud platforms

Examples:

* AWS SSO
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Okta

Used to manage access to many cloud services.

---

### 4️⃣ Home labs & self-hosting (your case)

People use SSO to protect:

* Nextcloud
* Grafana
* Portainer
* internal dashboards
* homelab apps

👉 This is exactly what you’re building with Ubuntu + Twingate.

---

## 🔥 Why SSO is powerful

### Benefits

✅ One password to remember
✅ Centralized security
✅ Easy MFA enforcement
✅ Easy user management
✅ Better audit logging
✅ Faster login experience

---

### Downsides (important)

⚠️ If SSO goes down → everything stops
⚠️ If SSO account compromised → many apps exposed
⚠️ Setup complexity

Good systems mitigate these with MFA and redundancy.

---

## 🧪 Common SSO technologies

You’ll see these a lot:

* **OAuth2** → authorization framework
* **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** → modern SSO (most common today)
* **SAML** → older enterprise SSO

👉 For your lab: **OIDC with Keycloak** is the best path.

---

## 🎯 In your Ubuntu + Twingate lab

SSO would let you:

* login once to Keycloak
* access all your internal apps
* protect services behind Twingate
* add MFA easily
