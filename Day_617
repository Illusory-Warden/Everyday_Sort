# 🏠 1️⃣ Your homelab (best starting point)

This is where most self-hosters begin.

You can use your SSO to log into:

### Infrastructure tools

* Grafana
* Prometheus
* Portainer
* Proxmox
* Kibana

👉 Result: one login for your entire lab.

**This is the easiest and most common use case.**

---

# 🌐 2️⃣ Self-hosted apps

Many popular apps support OIDC/SAML.

Examples that work great with Keycloak:

### Productivity & storage

* Nextcloud
* OwnCloud
* Seafile

### Development

* GitLab
* Gitea
* Jenkins

### Media & home services

* Jellyfin
* Immich
* Home Assistant

👉 Your SSO becomes the central login for your whole personal cloud.

---

# 🏢 3️⃣ Internal company tools (small org / startup)

If you ever run a team or startup, your SSO can manage access to:

* internal dashboards
* admin panels
* company wiki
* VPN access
* Kubernetes dashboard

This is how real companies use Keycloak/Okta.

# 🔐 4️⃣ Protect apps behind Twingate (your current stack)

This is **very powerful** for you.

### Architecture

```text
User → Twingate → Keycloak (SSO) → Internal apps
```

OR

```text
User → App → Keycloak login → access
```

You can:

* require SSO before network access
* enforce MFA centrally
* control user permissions

👉 This is basically zero-trust architecture at home.

---

# 🌍 5️⃣ Your own websites or web apps

If you build websites (Node, Django, etc.), you can:

* add “Login with your SSO”
* manage users centrally
* avoid writing auth yourself

Developers love this.

---

# 📱 6️⃣ Mobile apps (advanced)

OIDC works for mobile too.

You could build:

* Android app
* Flutter app
* React Native app

…and use your SSO as the login provider.

⚠️ More advanced but totally possible.

---

# 🧪 7️⃣ Learning enterprise IAM (HUGE career value)

Honestly, one of the **best reasons** to self-host SSO is learning.

Skills you gain:

* OAuth2 / OIDC
* SAML
* Identity federation
* Zero Trust
* Access management
* MFA

These are **high-demand DevOps/Security skills**.

---

# 🚫 Where you usually CANNOT use your SSO

Important reality check.

Your self-hosted SSO generally **cannot replace**:

* Google account login for Gmail
* Microsoft account
* random third-party sites

Because those services don’t trust your IdP.

SSO works when:

✅ you control the app
✅ or the app allows custom OIDC/SAML

---

# 🎯 Best practical use cases for YOU right now
