## ‚úÖ How you can use ready-made code/models:

1. **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNNs**

   * Popular CNNs like **VGG16, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet** are already trained on large datasets (like ImageNet).
   * You only need to **replace the final layer** with one that matches your dataset‚Äôs number of classes (e.g., tumor vs. no tumor).
   * Then you can fine-tune the model on your dataset.

   üëâ Example in Keras/PyTorch:

   * Import a model (`ResNet50`, `EfficientNet`) with `weights="imagenet"`.
   * Freeze the first few layers (to keep learned features).
   * Add a new classification head (Dense/Softmax layer).
   * Train on your dataset.

2. **Open-Source Code Repositories (GitHub, Kaggle, Papers With Code)**

   * You can find **ready-to-use CNN training pipelines** for medical image classification.
   * Just plug in your dataset (Brain Tumor, Lung Cancer, Skin Cancer) by updating the **dataset loading section**.
   * Train and get accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

   ‚ö° Tip: Search with queries like

   * `"brain tumor CNN classification GitHub"`
   * `"lung cancer CNN keras pytorch"`
   * `"skin cancer image classification transfer learning"`

3. **Kaggle & TensorFlow Datasets**

   * Kaggle has **notebooks with complete CNN models** (including preprocessing, augmentation, training, and evaluation).
   * You can **fork a notebook** and simply swap in your dataset.
   * Saves huge time because code for metrics, plots, confusion matrix, etc., is already there.

4. **Frameworks to Speed Up Work**

   * **Keras/TensorFlow** ‚Üí easiest for transfer learning (`tf.keras.applications`).
   * **PyTorch + torchvision** ‚Üí flexible, widely used in research.
   * **fastai** ‚Üí very quick prototyping with transfer learning.

## ‚úÖ Advantages of using ready-made models:

* Saves time ‚è≥ (you don‚Äôt need to design CNN from scratch).
* Better accuracy üìà (pre-trained models already know general features like edges, shapes, textures).
* Easier comparison üîé (since many papers also use standard CNN architectures).
* Less risk of overfitting (compared to small custom CNNs).

## ‚úÖ Practical Approach for You:

1. Start with **transfer learning CNNs**:

   * VGG16
   * ResNet50
   * EfficientNetB0 or B3

2. Use **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, zooming) to expand dataset.

3. Evaluate metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

4. Compare results with the target research paper.
