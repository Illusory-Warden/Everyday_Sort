## **Q2. Compare & contrast Behavioural Economics vs Classical Economics**

### **Answer:**

**Introduction:**
Economics traditionally relied on **Classical (or Neoclassical) Economics**, which assumes people are fully rational and markets are efficient. However, **Behavioural Economics** emerged to include insights from psychology, showing that real-world decisions often deviate from rationality due to biases, emotions, and heuristics.

### **Key Differences Between Classical and Behavioural Economics**

| **Aspect**                  | **Classical Economics**                                                | **Behavioural Economics**                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assumption about Humans** | Homo Economicus â€“ perfectly rational, self-interested decision-makers. | Humans are boundedly rational, influenced by psychology, biases, and emotions.    |
| **Decision-Making**         | Based on logic, optimization, and full information.                    | Based on heuristics (rules of thumb), mental shortcuts, and limited information.  |
| **Utility**                 | People maximize utility consistently.                                  | Utility is influenced by reference points, fairness, and social preferences.      |
| **Risk Attitude**           | Risk-neutral/risk-averse depending on expected utility.                | Shows loss aversion, overconfidence, and probability weighting (Prospect Theory). |
| **Time Preferences**        | Consistent over time (rational discounting of future).                 | Present bias and hyperbolic discounting (people prefer immediate rewards).        |
| **Market Predictions**      | Markets are efficient, correcting irrationalities quickly.             | Markets can show persistent anomalies (herding, bubbles, overreaction).           |
| **Scope**                   | Economics isolated from psychology.                                    | Interdisciplinary: economics + psychology + sociology + neuroscience.             |

### **Examples:**

* **Classical View:** Consumers always buy the cheapest product of equal quality.
* **Behavioural View:** Consumers may buy a more expensive brand due to loyalty, framing effects, or social influence.

### **Conclusion:**

While **Classical Economics** provides neat models based on rationality, **Behavioural Economics** offers a more realistic understanding by considering human psychology and deviations from rational behavior. Today, both approaches complement each other in explaining economic decision-making.
