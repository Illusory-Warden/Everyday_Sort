## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. **RDBMS (Relational DBMS)**
- MySQL stores data in **tables** (like spreadsheets).
- Tables are made of **rows and columns**.
- You can **relate** one table to another using **keys** (like primary keys and foreign keys).

---

### 2. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- SQL is the language used to **interact** with MySQL.
- With SQL, you can:
  - `SELECT` – Retrieve data
  - `INSERT` – Add new data
  - `UPDATE` – Modify existing data
  - `DELETE` – Remove data
  - Create/Alter tables, views, users, etc.

## 🔧 How MySQL Works

1. **Client** sends an SQL query
2. **MySQL Server** receives it
3. Parses, optimizes, and executes the query
4. Returns **results** or **confirmation**
