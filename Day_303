Here’s the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM products
ORDER BY category ASC;
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* `DISTINCT category` ensures each category is returned only once.
* `ORDER BY category ASC` sorts the categories alphabetically for easier readability.

### Expected Output:

| category    |
| ----------- |
| Accessories |
| Clothing    |
| Electronics |
| Homeware    |
