## 🔷 STEP 1: Understand the Scope (Entities & Data You Have)

Before we design anything, we need to know:

### 🔍 What kind of real information do you have about your class?

Please tell me what kind of data you've been given. For example:

* List of students (name, roll number, email, etc.)
* Courses or subjects they study
* Faculty/teachers teaching them
* Attendance records
* Marks/grades
* Class timetable
* Departments or sections
* Extracurricular activities
* Assignments/submissions
* Exams

Please **list everything** you’ve got or been allowed to include. The more detailed you are, the more realistic and normalized our database will be.

## 🛠️ STEP 2: Once We Know the Data — We Will:

1. **Identify Entities (Tables)** — like Student, Course, Faculty, etc.
2. **Define Attributes (Columns)** — e.g., student\_id, name, email.
3. **Define Relationships** — e.g., many students attend many courses.
4. **Normalize the Schema** — ensure 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.
5. **Add Primary & Foreign Keys** — for relational integrity.
6. **Design an ER Diagram (optional)** — to visualize.
7. **Generate SQL Code** — to create the DB and tables.
8. **Add Sample Data** — with `INSERT INTO` queries.
9. **Query Examples** — like joins, aggregations, etc.
