Good morning Sir,

I've received a 3-month internship offer which is a great opportunity for my career, but our summer vacation is only 1 month long. I need leave for the last two lectures daily for the additional 2 months.

Me and my friend Abhijeet Pathode spoke to Sen Sir (our HoD) about this, but he said no to the extended leave. I'm wondering if there are any alternative approaches or bypass methods to make this work.

Could you please guide me about:
Any other procedures or channels I can explore
Different departments or authorities I could approach
How to present a stronger case for approval
Ways to balance academics during internship
Required documentation that might help my case

I'm really committed to not letting this affect my studies and would appreciate any suggestions to manage both effectively or find alternative solutions.

Would it be possible to discuss this with you? Please let me know when you're available.

Thank you for your time and guidance, Sir.
