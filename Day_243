To uninstall Gigolo after installing it with `sudo apt install gigolo`, you can use these commands:

## Method 1: Complete Removal (Recommended)
```bash
sudo apt remove --purge gigolo
```
This removes Gigolo and its configuration files.

## Method 2: Basic Removal
```bash
sudo apt remove gigolo
```
This removes Gigolo but keeps configuration files (in case you want to reinstall later).

## Method 3: Remove with Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt autoremove --purge gigolo
```
This removes Gigolo, its config files, and any dependencies that were installed with it and are no longer needed.

## Clean Up After Removal:
```bash
# Clean the package cache
sudo apt autoclean

# Remove any leftover dependencies
sudo apt autoremove
```

## Check if Gigolo is Completely Removed:
```bash
# Check if the package is still installed
dpkg -l | grep gigolo

# Check if the binary still exists
which gigolo
```

If the commands return nothing, Gigolo has been successfully removed.

## Alternative: Using apt-get
If you prefer `apt-get`:
```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge gigolo
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

## Note:
- Your personal Gigolo bookmarks/settings are typically stored in `~/.config/gigolo/` - these won't be removed automatically
- If you want to remove these manually: `rm -rf ~/.config/gigolo/`

The `--purge` flag is recommended as it ensures complete removal including configuration files.
