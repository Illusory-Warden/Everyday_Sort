# ✅ **1. What are V, E, b, and m?**

### **V and E (Graph Terminology)**

Used in typical graph theory:

* **V** = number of vertices (nodes)
* **E** = number of edges
  DFS time/space complexity in graph theory is:
* Time: **O(V + E)**
* Space: **O(V)**

---

# ✅ **2. b and m (Search Tree Terminology)**

Used in *state-space search* (AI algorithms like DFS, BFS, A*, etc.):

* **b = branching factor**
  Number of children each node has on average.

* **m = maximum depth**
  How deep the search tree can go.

This notation is used when DFS is applied as a **tree search**, not a graph traversal.

# ✅ **3. So what is O(bᵐ)?**

### **O(bᵐ)** means:

> The number of nodes DFS might explore in the **worst case**, for a tree of branching factor *b* and maximum depth *m*.

Why?

At each level, the number of nodes grows by a factor of **b**, so:

* Level 0: 1 node
* Level 1: b nodes
* Level 2: b² nodes
* …
* Level m: bᵐ nodes

DFS may go all the way to the bottom → exploring up to **bᵐ nodes**.

Therefore:

* **Time Complexity = O(bᵐ)**
* **Space Complexity = O(bm)** (depth of the recursion stack)

This applies in AI search textbooks (Russell & Norvig, etc.), not typical graph DFS.
