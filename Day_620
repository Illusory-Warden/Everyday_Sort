# 🔥 FINAL CLEAN RESET (Guaranteed Fix)

## ✅ STEP 1 — Delete .git again

Run:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2 — Clear notebook outputs (VERY IMPORTANT)

Open:

```
Code/Course_Recommendation.ipynb
```

Then:

* Click top right `...`
* Click **Clear All Outputs**
* Save the file

Then search again:

```
Ctrl + F → gsk_
```

Make sure it does NOT exist anywhere.

Save again.

---

## ✅ STEP 3 — Reinitialize Git

```bash
git init
```

---

## ✅ STEP 4 — Add files

```bash
git add .
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5 — Create ONE fresh commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial clean commit"
```

---

## ✅ STEP 6 — Rename branch

```bash
git branch -M main
```

---

## ✅ STEP 7 — Force push

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/DM_Abhijeet.git
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

🚨 IMPORTANT

If it STILL blocks after this, then:

That means the API key is still present somewhere inside the notebook JSON (even in hidden metadata).

In that case I will give you a nuclear fix:
Convert notebook → new notebook → copy code only.

But first try this full clean reset.
