Microservices are an architectural approach to building software systems that structures an application as a collection of **small, independent, and loosely coupled services**. Each service is:

- **Focused on a specific business function** (like user management, payment processing, etc.)
- **Developed and deployed independently**
- Communicates with other services through **lightweight protocols** (often HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues)

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice does one thing well.
2. **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service typically has its own database.
3. **Independent Deployment**: Services can be updated, deployed, or scaled without affecting the entire system.
4. **Technology Agnostic**: Services can be built using different programming languages or frameworks.
5. **Fault Isolation**: If one microservice fails, the rest of the system can continue to function.

### Example:
Think of an e-commerce application:
- Product Service – manages product listings
- Order Service – handles order processing
- Payment Service – processes payments
- User Service – manages user profiles

Each service can be developed by a separate team and scaled as needed.

### Benefits:
- Faster development and deployment cycles
- Easier scalability
- Better fault tolerance
- Flexibility in using different technologies

### Challenges:
- Increased complexity in communication and data consistency
- Requires good DevOps and monitoring practices
- Network latency and failure handling
