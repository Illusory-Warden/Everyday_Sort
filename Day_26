## üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Case

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre tasked with gathering OSINT on a domain (e.g., `example.com`). Here's a possible tool chain in Parrot OS:

1. **theHarvester** ‚Äì to extract emails and subdomains.
2. **WHOIS** / **dnsenum** ‚Äì to pull domain registration data.
3. **Maltego** ‚Äì visualize relationships (e.g., owners, contact info).
4. **Shodan CLI** ‚Äì find connected devices with that domain or IP.
5. **Metagoofil** ‚Äì download and extract metadata from public documents.
6. **SpiderFoot** ‚Äì run a full automated scan for emails, IPs, leaks.

## üß™ Tips for Using OSINT Tools in Parrot OS

- **Use VPN or Tor**: OSINT may involve checking sensitive resources‚Äîhide your IP.
- **API Keys**: Some tools (e.g., Shodan, Censys) need API keys‚Äîget them from the official site.
- **Legal Boundaries**: OSINT only uses public data, but always act within legal and ethical boundaries.
