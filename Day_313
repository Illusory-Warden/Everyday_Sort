n - k = 1 \quad \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; k = n - 1
$$

**Exactly, $k = n-1$.**
So strictly speaking, **$k = n$ is not correct**.

But: in algorithm analysis (recurrences, substitution, recursion trees), people sometimes **approximate** and say $k \approx n$ because:

* Asymptotically, $n-1$ and $n$ are the same (they both grow like $n$).
* In $\Theta$-notation, the difference of a constant (like 1) is ignored.

âœ… So the answer is:

* **Exactly:** $k = n-1$.
* **Asymptotically / approximately in big-O analysis:** some people simplify and write $k=n$, since the $-1$ does not change the result.
