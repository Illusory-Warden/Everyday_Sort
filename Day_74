## 🔷 **Class-A Chopper (First Quadrant Chopper)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

It operates in the **first quadrant** where both voltage and current are **positive**. Also known as a **step-down chopper**.

---

### ⚙️ **Circuit Diagram:**

```
+Vdc ───┬──────┐
        │     │
       [SW]  [RL Load]
        │     │
       GND ──|<|──┘
           (Diode)
```

---

### 🧠 **Operation:**

* **Switch ON:**
  Load is connected to source.
  $V_o = V_{in}$, $I_o > 0$

* **Switch OFF:**
  Diode conducts. Inductor maintains current.
  $V_o = 0$, $I_o > 0$

---

### 📐 **Quadrant:**

* First quadrant (Vo > 0, Io > 0)

---

### 📊 **Waveforms:**

* Voltage: Pulsating between 0 and Vin
* Current: Continuous (for RL load)

---

### 📝 **Application:**

* DC motor control (forward motoring)

---

## 🔷 **Class-B Chopper (Second Quadrant Chopper)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

Operates in the **second quadrant**, with **positive voltage** and **negative current**. Used for **regenerative braking**.

---

### ⚙️ **Circuit Diagram:**

```
+Vdc ─────┐
         [D]
          |─────┐
         [SW]  [Load]
          |     |
         GND   GND
```

---

### 🧠 **Operation:**

* **Load current is forced in reverse direction.**
* **Switch ON:** Load stores energy in the inductor.
* **Switch OFF:** Inductor releases energy → diode conducts → energy fed back to the source.

---

### 📐 **Quadrant:**

* Second quadrant (Vo > 0, Io < 0)

---

### 📝 **Application:**

* Regenerative braking of DC motors

---

## 🔷 **Class-C Chopper (Two Quadrant Type-A Chopper)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

Combines Class-A and Class-B in parallel → allows **bidirectional current** with **positive voltage**.

---

### ⚙️ **Circuit Diagram:**

```
     +Vdc
      │
     [SW1]
      │──────┐
     [D1]   [Load]
      │      │

            [D2]
             │
            GND
```

---

### 🧠 **Operation:**

* **SW1 ON, SW2 OFF:** Class-A (motoring)
* **SW2 ON, SW1 OFF:** Class-B (regenerative braking)

---

### 📐 **Quadrant:**

* First and Second (Vo > 0, Io ±)

---

### 📝 **Application:**

* Electric traction
* Bidirectional DC drives

---

## 🔷 **Class-D Chopper (Two Quadrant Type-B Chopper)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

Provides **bidirectional voltage** with **unidirectional current**. Used where voltage reversal is required.

---

### ⚙️ **Circuit Diagram:**

```
      +Vdc

      │     │              │
     GND   GND            GND
```

---

### 🧠 **Operation:**

* SW1 and D2 conduct → +Vo
* SW2 and D1 conduct → -Vo

**Current always flows from left to right (positive), but voltage can reverse.**

---

### 📐 **Quadrant:**

* First and Fourth (Io > 0, Vo ±)

---

### 📝 **Application:**

* DC traction
* Reversible voltage supplies

---

## 🔷 **Class-E Chopper (Four Quadrant Chopper)**

---

### ⚙️ **Circuit Diagram:**

Essentially a combination of **Class-C and Class-D** choppers (or an H-bridge with four switches and four diodes).

```
     +Vdc

             GND
```

* Each switch has a freewheeling diode in antiparallel.

---

### 🧠 **Operation:**

* Control of all four combinations of Vo and Io:

  * (+Vo, +Io) → 1st quadrant
  * (+Vo, -Io) → 2nd quadrant
  * (-Vo, -Io) → 3rd quadrant
  * (-Vo, +Io) → 4th quadrant

---

### 📐 **Quadrants:**

* First, Second, Third, Fourth

### 📝 **Application:**

* Four-quadrant DC motor drives
* Robotics
* Industrial automation
