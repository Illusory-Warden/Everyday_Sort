1. **ABS filament (8 kg):**

   * Do you want it in **1 kg spools** (8 spools) or bigger spools if available?
   * Preferred brand (budget/Indian brand like WOL3D, 3Idea, etc. vs premium like eSUN)?

2. **Filament dryer:**

   * Do you want a **single-spool dryer** (compact, ~~₹2k–₹5k) or a **dual-spool/pro dryer** (~~₹7k–₹12k)?

3. **Shipping materials:**

   * Do you want me to budget for **cardboard containers + custom foam sockets** or just **generic cartons + foam sheets/blocks**? (Custom sockets may require fabrication, costlier.)

4. **Train tickets (Nagpur ↔ Bilaspur via Vande Bharat):**

   * Travel class? (Executive Chair Car or AC Chair Car — Vande Bharat usually has both, fare difference is large).
   * Do you want me to show the **estimated total fare** or just prepare it as a BOM line item with a link to IRCTC for booking? (I cannot actually book, but I can fetch latest fares and give direct IRCTC link).
