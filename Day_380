For the **Cron node**, once you’ve set:

* **Mode** → *Every Day*
* **Hour** → `7`
* **Minute** → `0`

…you’re basically done ✅.

No extra fields are needed unless you want something fancy (like timezones, custom cron expressions, or multiple schedules). For a simple daily trigger, what we did is enough.
