## 📘 **Case Study: AirAsia Builds Disaster Recovery on AWS**

### 🏢 Organization

**AirAsia**
**Industry:** Aviation / Transportation
**Headquarters:** Malaysia

## 🚨 Challenge: Ensuring Business Continuity for Critical Systems

AirAsia, one of Asia's largest low-cost carriers, depends heavily on its digital platforms for:

* **Flight booking**
* **Passenger check-in**
* **Operations and logistics**
* **Customer service portals**

Any downtime could mean **loss of revenue**, **reputational damage**, and **disrupted customer experience**.

**Key risks:**

* Data center outages due to power failures, fire, or natural disasters
* Manual recovery procedures were slow and error-prone
* Lack of real-time redundancy and geographic failover
* High cost and complexity of traditional DR solutions

---

## 💡 Solution: Disaster Recovery on AWS

AirAsia adopted a **cloud-native disaster recovery (DR) strategy using AWS**, which allowed them to:

1. Replicate on-premises workloads to AWS.
2. Enable rapid recovery in a secondary region.
3. Automate infrastructure provisioning and failover.

### 🔧 Key AWS Services Used:

| AWS Service                             | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)** | Real-time replication of workloads from on-prem to AWS   |
| **Amazon EC2**                          | Provisioning compute resources in disaster recovery mode |
| **Amazon S3**                           | Secure backup storage for application and customer data  |
| **Amazon Route 53**                     | DNS failover routing to alternate regions                |
| **AWS CloudFormation**                  | Automated recovery infrastructure as code                |
| **Amazon RDS**                          | Replication of critical databases for quick failover     |

## ✅ Results

| Outcome                                    | Impact                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reduced RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**  | From several hours to **under 15 minutes**                |
| **Reduced RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | Near real-time replication via AWS DRS                    |
| **Lowered Costs**                          | Pay-as-you-go model reduced CAPEX by **over 40%**         |
| **Increased Availability**                 | Systems remained operational during outages and DR drills |
| **Faster Compliance Audits**               | Easily met aviation regulatory requirements for DR        |

## ✈️ Real-World Incident: Data Center Cooling Failure

In 2019, one of AirAsia’s primary data centers experienced a **cooling system failure** during peak operational hours. Thanks to the AWS-based DR plan:

* Mission-critical applications automatically failed over to AWS.
* Passengers continued to check-in and board without delays.
* Engineers used AWS CloudFormation to spin up mirrored infrastructure in minutes.
* No data loss occurred due to continuous replication via AWS DRS.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1. **Automation reduces recovery time** – Infrastructure-as-code allowed AirAsia to spin up systems quickly and consistently.
2. **Hybrid models offer flexibility** – They maintained key on-prem operations with AWS as a warm standby.
3. **Testing is critical** – Regular DR drills in AWS helped identify gaps and build confidence across teams.

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

AirAsia implemented strict access controls, encryption, and monitoring through:

* **AWS IAM**
* **Amazon GuardDuty**
* **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**

They met regional compliance and aviation IT regulations with robust AWS logging and audit trails.

## 📌 Summary

By migrating its disaster recovery to AWS, **AirAsia gained faster recovery times, lower costs, and greater resilience**. Their cloud-based DR strategy helped ensure uninterrupted service for passengers and regulatory compliance for the business.

> “AWS allowed us to reduce our recovery time from hours to minutes while keeping costs under control. It changed the way we think about resilience.”
