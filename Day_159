## ðŸŽ¤ **Legislate AI â€“ Legal Help for the Underrepresented**

**5-Minute Pitch Script**

---

**\[Opening â€“ 30 seconds]**

Good \[morning/afternoon], everyone.

Today, millions of people across India face legal problems â€” land disputes, domestic abuse, pension issues â€” yet they remain silent.

Why?
Because for rural and low-income communities, the legal system feels impossible to navigate. Lawyers are expensive. Documents are complicated. And everythingâ€™s in English or official Hindi â€” not in the language they speak.

At **Legislate AI**, we believe access to justice is a right â€” not a luxury.

**\[The Problem â€“ 1 minute]**

Let me explain the real challenges:

* People donâ€™t know their basic rights under Indian law.
* Legal help isnâ€™t available in regional languages like Telugu, Marathi, or Kannada.
* There's a deep fear of interacting with police, courts, or bureaucracy.
* Legal services are too costly for daily wage workers and rural citizens.
* Existing apps? Theyâ€™re not designed for people without legal or digital literacy.

The result? Millions suffer silently, unable to even file a basic FIR or RTI request.
