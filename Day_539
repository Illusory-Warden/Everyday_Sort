### 1️⃣ How old is Unnati & where are prizes officially mentioned?

* Intel Unnati was formally launched in **Oct 2021**. ([Newsroom][1])
* Since then, Intel’s own brochures (HPC, AIoT, Security, DL, etc.) all say the same thing:
  **cash awards + internship evaluation** are attached to:

  * **Intel Unnati Grand Challenge**
  * **Intel Unnati Rapid Challenge** ([Intel][2])

These are **multi-college competitions**, not simple “best in college” rankings.

### 2️⃣ College-level stuff: can there be cash? Yes, but it’s not automatic

There *are* examples where students got prize money in events that *happened* at or via a single college, but:

* At **NMIT, Bengaluru**, their Intel Unnati Lab page says:

  > “Project Awards: Teams won the best project award with prize money from Intel.” ([nitte.edu.in][3])
  > This sounds like internal **best-project awards** for Unnati projects, with money sponsored via the program.
* At **Sri Sairam group of institutions**, one student was:

  > awarded a cash prize of ₹30,000 and was one of the top 10 winners among 1100 participants in “Intel Unnati Industrial Summer 2023 Conclave.” ([mtechcse.sairam.edu.in][4])
  > That looks like a bigger conclave/contest, not just “topper of one college list”.
* The **Intel Unnati Catalyst leaflet** says Intel may **sponsor awards** for events branded as “An Intel Unnati Catalyst Event”, and will fund awards for the **top 3 winners in each event** (up to 10 events). ([Intel][5])
  Those events could be hackathons / project contests hosted *inside a college*. But again, that’s **a separate competition**, not just the basic training list.

So: yes, college-hosted Unnati events *can* have cash prizes – sometimes even funded by Intel – but **only if the college organizes such a contest and gets Catalyst/Unnati sponsorship**.

### 3️⃣ Your specific situation: this nomination list 📝

The list you’re on right now is for **Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program 2025** (college nominations).

From all official docs I could find:

* The **Industrial Training Program** promises:

  * Training
  * Project work
  * **Certificate** on successful completion
    No mention of “cash prize if you are rank 1 in your college.” ([Intel][6])
* Cash prizes clearly appear only when talking about **Grand Challenge / Rapid Challenge / Catalyst events**, which are **competitions**, not basic training.

So for your direct question:

> “Are there any cash prizes for just college level winning (not inter college)?”

Honest answer:

* **From Intel side (default):**
  ❌ No *standard* cash prize just for “college-level topper” in Industrial Training.
* **From college side (optional):**
  ✅ Your college **might** announce internal awards (best project, best team etc.), *sometimes* supported by Intel Unnati Catalyst or other sponsors – but that’s totally **college-specific** and not guaranteed.
