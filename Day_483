[
T(n) = C \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n} 2^i
]

turns into

[
T(n) = C \cdot (2n - 1)
]

and why it is (O(n)).

### Step 1: Identify the geometric series

We have a sum:

[
\sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n} 2^i
]

* First term: (2^0 = 1)
* Common ratio: (r = 2) (each term is double the previous)
* Last term: (2^{\log_2 n})

The **formula for a geometric series** is:

[
\sum_{i=0}^{m} r^i = \frac{r^{m+1}-1}{r-1}
]

Here:

* (r = 2)
* (m = \log_2 n)

---

### Step 2: Apply the formula

[
\sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n} 2^i = \frac{2^{(\log_2 n)+1} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{\log_2 n + 1} - 1
]

> Note: (2 - 1 = 1), so the denominator disappears.

---

### Step 3: Simplify (2^{\log_2 n + 1})

Use the property of exponents:

[
2^{\log_2 n + 1} = 2^{\log_2 n} \cdot 2^1
]

[
2^{\log_2 n} = n \quad \text{(because logarithms and exponents are inverses)}
]

So:

[
2^{\log_2 n + 1} = n \cdot 2 = 2n
]

---

### Step 4: Subtract 1

[
2^{\log_2 n + 1} - 1 = 2n - 1
]

---

### Step 5: Multiply by (C) (from our recurrence)

[
T(n) = C \cdot (2n - 1)
]

Since constants don’t affect asymptotic complexity:

[
T(n) = O(n)
]

✅ **Summary:**

1. Recognize the geometric series.
2. Use the sum formula (\sum r^i = \frac{r^{m+1}-1}{r-1}).
3. Simplify the exponent using (2^{\log_2 n} = n).
4. Multiply by the constant (C).
5. Conclude (O(n)).
