An **Arithmetic Sequence** and an **Arithmetic Series** both use the **same formula for the nᵗʰ term**:

[
T_n = a + (n - 1)d
]

✔ **Arithmetic Sequence** = the sequence itself
✔ **Arithmetic Series** = the *sum* of the terms

The nᵗʰ term formula belongs to the **sequence**, but it is also used when working with the **series**, because you often need (T_n) to find the sum.
