| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Introduction** | Greet, grab attention (story, quote, question), introduce topic |
| **Body**         | 2–3 main points with examples and visuals                       |
| **Conclusion**   | Summarize, give a takeaway, end with impact                     |

### 🔷 4. **Use Simple Language**

* Avoid difficult words or long sentences.
* Use bullet points, headlines, or analogies.

**Example:**
Instead of saying *“utilize time efficiently”*, say *“use your time well.”*

### 🔷 5. **Make It Engaging**

Use:

* **Stories** or real-life examples
* **Questions** to involve audience
* **Visuals** (charts, images, videos)
