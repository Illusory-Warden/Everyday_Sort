## Where to Find Ready-to-Use OpenRocket Models

### 1. RocketReviews – *OpenRocket Design Library*

A vast curated collection of `.ork` files available for direct download. Many non-military and commercial model designs are available and often well-documented. ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][1])

### 2. Rocketry Forum – *K'Tesh's OpenRocket Files*

K'Tesh, a prolific contributor, has shared hundreds of `.ork` files on the Rocketry Forum. These include popular Estes kits like:

* Estes Mini Max
* Estes Citation Series Red Max (multiple variants)
* Estes Der Red Max (2007 re-release)
* Estes Mega Der Red Max
* Estes Der Big Red Max (1977) and Big Red Max II (2-stage) ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][2])

These are ideal starting points if you're looking for stable, tried-and-tested designs.

### 3. Rocketry Forum – *Download OpenRocket Designs Thread*

A helpful community thread that aggregates links and tips to downloadable designs, including both `.ork` and RockSim (`.rkt`) files (which OpenRocket can import). ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][3])

### 4. OpenRocket Distribution Archive

An archived site (“openrocket.distrib.free.fr”) attempted to distribute `.ork` designs widely. However, be cautious—the software available there is outdated and may not be compatible with the latest version of OpenRocket. ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][3])

## Insights from the Community

> “File > Open Example has several example files. While none of them is really '10,000 feet altitude rocket,' they do demonstrate many features of OpenRocket.” ([Reddit][4])

Community users suggest starting with built-in examples to explore features and simulation behaviors.

> On using Estes kits or motors within OpenRocket:
> “This website has a lot of Rocksim files (usable in OpenRocket)…” ([Reddit][4])

That means you can adapt many existing RockSim designs into OpenRocket for experimentation.

> On building from downloaded models versus scratch:
> Many users recommend creating your own files—often simpler and more accurate for your specific model. Downloaded designs might not always reflect real-world dimensions or masses perfectly. ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][3])

1. **Browse the RocketReviews design library** to find models that match your style or level.
2. **Explore K’Tesh’s threads** on Rocketry Forum for a rich collection of downloadable `.ork` files.
3. **Load built-in example files** via `File > Open Example` in OpenRocket to experiment with design and stability.
4. **Use downloaded models as templates**—adjust dimensions, masses, or aesthetics for your custom builds.
5. **Consider designing from scratch** if you want complete control or to replicate a military-inspired model like "Steel Rain" with accuracy.
