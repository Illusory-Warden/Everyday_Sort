Q.30 Case Study: Revamping the Product Description for “EcoSip” – A Sustainable
Water Bottle
EcoSip, a startup focused on sustainable living, released a reusable water bottle made from
biodegradable materials. The original product description on their website was:
“EcoSip is a 750ml eco-friendly water bottle made from biodegradable plastic. Lightweight,
durable, and safe for the environment.”
Despite good product quality and customer reviews, sales were stagnant. After conducting a
customer behavior analysis, the marketing team revised the product description to be more
engaging and emotionally resonant:
“Say goodbye to plastic waste. The EcoSip 750ml bottle is your stylish, guilt-free hydration
companion—crafted from plant-based materials, built to last, and designed with purpose.
Durable, lightweight, and eco-conscious—because the Earth deserves better.”
Sales increased by 30% in the following quarter. Customers reported feeling more
connected to the brand’s mission and appreciated the storytelling aspect of the revised
description.
a) How did the revised product description differ in tone and content from the original?
What elements contributed most to the increase in customer engagement?
b) Do you think emotional appeal is more effective than factual listing in product
descriptions? Why or why not? Support your argument with examples.

corporate clients or school students—while maintaining the brand&#39;s values.
d) Imagine you are launching a new eco-friendly lunchbox. Based on the EcoSip case,

proposition (USP) for EcoSip that could be used in a promotional campaign.

She said:
“Success is not about titles or wealth; it’s about staying true to your values when it’s hardest
to do so. You are not just graduating with degrees—you are stepping into the world as
creators of change. Don’t wait for the world to be better. Be the reason it becomes better.”

Q.32 Scenario: Team Conflict in a Project Deadline
In a mid-sized tech company, a team of five employees was assigned a high-stakes project
with a tight deadline. As the deadline approached, tension grew between two key
members—Ravi, the lead developer, and Asha, the project coordinator.
Ravi felt Asha was micromanaging and not respecting his technical decisions. Asha believed
Ravi was being uncooperative and not communicating progress clearly. Their constant
disagreements slowed the team&#39;s momentum, caused frustration among other members,
and threatened the success of the project.
The manager called for a conflict resolution meeting using the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict
Management Tool. During the session, they identified their default conflict styles—Ravi
leaned toward avoiding, while Asha used a competing style. The manager encouraged
them to adopt a collaborating approach, focusing on shared goals, open communication,
and mutual respect.
After the meeting, the team saw marked improvement in dynamics and successfully
completed the project on time.
a) What were the underlying causes of the conflict between Ravi and Asha? How did
their individual conflict management styles influence the situation?

part-time work, club leadership, and personal commitments. She often starts her
assignments late, forgets deadlines, and feels overwhelmed. Despite working long
hours, her performance is declining, and her stress levels are rising.

better overall balance. Her stress decreases, and she even finds time for self-care and
hobbies.
a) What were the key factors contributing to Anika’s time management issues? How did
her choices affect her academic and personal well-being?
b) Design a weekly time management plan for a student like Anika using digital tools or
planners. Ensure it includes study, work, leisure, and self-care.
