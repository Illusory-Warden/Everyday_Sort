if youâ€™ve already uploaded your driverâ€™s license through LinkedInâ€™s **Persona verification system**, youâ€™re on the right track. Thatâ€™s their standard method for confirming identity in locked or restricted account cases.

### Hereâ€™s what to expect next:

#### âœ… What happens now:

* **LinkedIn (via Persona)** will review your ID.
* If everything checks out, theyâ€™ll **unlock your account within 24â€“72 hours**.
* Youâ€™ll receive an email at the address linked to your account (probably the new one you added).

### ðŸ“¬ What you can do in the meantime:

1. **Check your email** (including spam/junk folders) regularly for LinkedIn updates.
2. If itâ€™s been **more than 3 days** and you haven't heard back:

   * Visit this support page: [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RCP](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RCP)
   * Submit a follow-up request explaining that you completed Persona ID verification and are still waiting.
