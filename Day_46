You're on the right track already! Since you've set up Twingate using Docker on your Raspberry Pi 4 running OpenMediaVault (OMV), here's what happens and what you need to check after a power cycle or maintenance shutdown:

### ✅ Good :
If you **properly set up Twingate with Docker and persistent volumes**, and you **did not delete the Docker container or the associated data**, then:

- You **do not** need to reconnect or reconfigure your Raspberry Pi to Twingate again.
- When you power your RPi back on, as long as Docker and the Twingate connector container are set to start on boot (or you manually restart it), it should **automatically reconnect** to your Twingate network.

---

### ✅ Things to verify after turning your RPi back on:

1. **Docker is running:**
   Make sure the Docker daemon started properly:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```

2. **Twingate container is running:**
   Check your running containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see your Twingate container there. If not, run:
   ```bash
   docker start <container_name_or_id>
   ```

3. **Container was set with restart policy:**
   When you created your Twingate container, if you used:
   ```bash
   --restart=always
   ```
   Then it should automatically start with your RPi on boot.

4. **Network connectivity:**
   - Check that your RPi has an internet connection.
   - Make sure no firewall or DNS issue is blocking Twingate from connecting.

5. **Twingate admin console:**
   You can log into your [Twingate admin console](https://admin.twingate.com) and confirm that your connector shows as "Connected" or "Online".

---

### ❌ When you'd need to reconfigure:
- If you deleted the Twingate Docker container and didn't use persistent storage/volumes.
- If the tokens expired and you didn't store them in a volume or ENV.
- If there were manual changes in OMV that affected Docker or networking setup.
