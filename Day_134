Here’s what you can do to unlock your LinkedIn account:

### 🔐 **Steps to Recover a Locked LinkedIn Account**

#### 1. **Go to the LinkedIn Account Recovery Page**

Visit: [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RCP](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RCP)

This form allows you to report that your account was locked and request access.

---

#### 2. **Fill Out the Account Recovery Form**

* **Email address:** Use the new email you added (or the original one, if still valid).
* **Description:** Explain clearly that you changed your email address, removed the old one, and your account got locked unexpectedly.

Example:

> *"Hi, I recently updated my email on my LinkedIn account and removed my old one. Right after doing this, my account was locked. This is my personal account and I need access restored. I can verify my identity if needed. Thank you!"*

#### 3. **Upload Your ID (If Prompted)**

LinkedIn might ask for a government-issued ID to confirm your identity. Make sure:

* Your name and photo are visible.
* You cover any personal info you're uncomfortable sharing (e.g., ID number), but **not your name or photo**.

---

#### 4. **Wait for LinkedIn’s Response**

They usually respond within **24–48 hours**, but it can take longer depending on volume.

---

### ✅ Additional Tips:

* If you still have access to your **registered device or app**, sometimes it will give you a quick identity verification option.
* **Don’t try to create a new account** — it can make things worse or delay recovery.
