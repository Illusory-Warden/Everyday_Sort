The problem asks for the single-source shortest path from node 1 (the implied source) to all other nodes in the given directed, weighted graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.The graph has $V=7$ vertices (nodes 1 through 7) and $E=11$ edges.The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing all edges $V-1$ times. After $V-1$ passes, the shortest path is found, provided there are no negative cycles reachable from the source. The $V$-th pass is used to detect negative cycles.
