**Question 5**
✔ **Option 4 (sequence numbers)** – TCP uses sequence numbers for reassembly.

**Question 6**
✔ **Option 2 (The web server will not acknowledge this segment. The PC1 timer will expire and PC1 will resend the segment.)**

**Question 7**

✔ **Option 5 (POP3)**
✔ **Option 6 (SMTP)** – These are email protocols.

**Question 10**

**Question 18**
