**PEAS** stands for:

* **P**: Performance Measure – Criteria to evaluate success.
* **E**: Environment – The surrounding where the agent operates.
* **A**: Actuators – Components that allow the agent to act on the environment.
* **S**: Sensors – Components that perceive the environment.

PEAS helps define the **task environment** for designing an intelligent agent.
