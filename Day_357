### ðŸ”¹ General Workflow Idea

1. **Trigger Node**

   * Example: **Webhook** (to upload the file via API request), or **Google Drive / Dropbox Trigger** (when a new file is uploaded).

2. **Get File Data**

   * The trigger will provide the raw file or a link to download it.

3. **Convert File**
   Options:

   * **API approach**: Use a service like [CloudConvert API](https://cloudconvert.com/api/v2) or [ConvertAPI](https://www.convertapi.com/).
   * **Local approach**: If your n8n is self-hosted with access to tools like `ffmpeg`, `pandoc`, `imagemagick`, or `libreoffice`, you can run a **Command Node** to convert directly.

4. **Return/Save File**

   * Upload converted file to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, etc.), or
   * Return it as a response (if using webhook).

### ðŸ”¹ Example (with CloudConvert API)

Hereâ€™s how it would look in n8n:

1. **Webhook Node**

   * Accepts `file` and `format` parameters (user provides file + desired format).

2. **HTTP Request Node â†’ Upload File to CloudConvert**

   * `POST` to CloudConvertâ€™s import endpoint with file data.

3. **HTTP Request Node â†’ Start Conversion**

   * Tell CloudConvert to convert from input format to target format.

4. **Wait for Conversion â†’ Download File**

   * Use another HTTP Request node to get the converted file URL.

5. **Respond with Converted File** (Webhook reply) or save to Drive/Dropbox/etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Example (Local Conversion with Pandoc for documents)

If you just want documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, ODT, etc.):

1. **Webhook Node** â†’ File comes in.
2. **Write Binary File Node** â†’ Save file temporarily.
3. **Execute Command Node** â†’ Run `pandoc input.docx -o output.pdf`.
4. **Read Binary File Node** â†’ Load converted file back.
5. **Webhook Response** â†’ Send converted file back.
