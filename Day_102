What are two actions performed by a Cisco switch? (Choose two.)

utilizing the MAC address table to forward frames via the destination MAC address

check_box_outline_blank
using the source MAC addresses of frames to build and maintain a MAC address table

check_box_outline_blank
forwarding frames with unknown destination IP addresses to the default gateway

check_box_outline_blank
examining the destination MAC address to add new entries to the MAC address table

check_box_outline_blank
building a routing table that is based on the first IP address in the frame header


✅ Correct answers:

✔️ Using the source MAC addresses of frames to build and maintain a MAC address table

✔️ Utilizing the MAC address table to forward frames via the destination MAC address

Explanation:
Cisco switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and primarily use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.

✔️ Correct Actions:
Using the source MAC address to build the MAC address table

When a frame enters the switch, the switch learns the source MAC address and associates it with the incoming port.

Using the MAC address table to forward frames via the destination MAC address

If the destination MAC address is found in the MAC table, the switch forwards the frame to the corresponding port.

❌ Incorrect Actions:
Forwarding frames with unknown destination IP addresses to the default gateway
→ Switches don’t use IP addresses for forwarding. That’s a router’s job.

Examining the destination MAC address to add new entries
→ The switch learns from the source MAC address, not the destination.

Building a routing table based on IP addresses
→ Switches don’t build routing tables. Routers do, at Layer 3.
