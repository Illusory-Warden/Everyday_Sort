### 🧮 Scenario

* You **buy** a stock for ₹1000 (delivery, i.e. CNC order).
* Tomorrow, you **sell** it when the price has increased **11%**, so:
  [
  \text{Sell price} = 1000 \times 1.11 = ₹1110
  ]
* You make a **₹110 profit** before charges.

Now let’s calculate **Groww’s actual delivery trading charges**.
