What is the purpose of the `novalidate` attribute on a `
` element?

It validates the form using Bootstrap's built-in rules.
It disables the browser's native HTML5 form validation.
It ensures the form cannot be submitted.
It marks all fields as optional.  


✅ **Correct answer:**
**It disables the browser's native HTML5 form validation.**

**Explanation:**
Adding the **`novalidate`** attribute to a `<form>` tells the browser **not to perform its built-in HTML5 validation** when the form is submitted.

This is useful if you want to **handle validation entirely with JavaScript** or a server-side process instead of relying on the browser’s default behavior.

Example:

```html
<form novalidate>
  <input type="email" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
