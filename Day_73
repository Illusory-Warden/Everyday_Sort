### âœ… Is SCR Current Controlled or Voltage Controlled?

**SCR is a *current-controlled* device.**

---
### ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

* To turn **ON** the SCR, a **small gate current** is applied between the **gate and cathode**.
* This small current initiates the larger current flow from **anode to cathode**.
* Once turned ON, the SCR **latches**, and the gate loses control â€” the SCR remains ON until the **anode current drops below a certain threshold** (called holding current).

ðŸ”¸ So, **the gate current is responsible for triggering**, not the gate voltage.
Hence, **SCR is a current-controlled device** â€” unlike MOSFETs or IGBTs, which are voltage-controlled.

### âœ… SCR Ratings

SCR ratings are important because they define the limits within which the device can operate **safely and reliably**.

Below are the **typical ratings** (approximate values â€” exact values vary depending on manufacturer and model):

| **Parameter**                     | **Symbol**        | **Typical Rating** | **Description**                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repetitive Peak Off-state Voltage | V<sub>DRM</sub>   | 600V â€“ 3000V       | Max voltage SCR can block repeatedly without turning ON.          |
| Average On-state Current          | I<sub>T(AV)</sub> | 10A â€“ 2000A        | Max average current SCR can handle when ON.                       |
| Gate Trigger Current              | I<sub>GT</sub>    | 50ÂµA â€“ 50mA        | Minimum gate current needed to turn ON the SCR.                   |
| Gate Trigger Voltage              | V<sub>GT</sub>    | 0.6V â€“ 2.5V        | Voltage required between gate and cathode to initiate conduction. |
| Holding Current                   | I<sub>H</sub>     | 2mA â€“ 100mA        | Minimum current below which SCR turns OFF.                        |
| Latching Current                  | I<sub>L</sub>     | 10mA â€“ 500mA       | Current needed to latch the SCR after triggering.                 |
| Surge Current                     | I<sub>TSM</sub>   | 100A â€“ 30kA        | Peak surge current SCR can tolerate for one cycle.                |

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Values vary across **low-power** and **high-power** SCRs.
