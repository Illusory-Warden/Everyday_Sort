Here’s the breakdown of what *can* run:

---

### **1. Stock & Modified Android**

* **Stock Samsung One UI** (what it comes with)
* **Custom ROMs** based on Android, if your model has an unlocked bootloader and a port:

  * **LineageOS** (most popular custom Android)
  * **Pixel Experience**
  * **/e/ OS** (privacy-focused)
  * **crDroid**, **ArrowOS**, etc.
* Benefits:

  * Fully working calls, Wi-Fi, cameras, etc.
  * Feels similar to stock Android but can be lighter, faster, or more private.

---

### **2. Kali Linux Inside Android**

* You won’t be replacing Android, but you can run a full Kali environment using:

  * **Kali NetHunter** (Rootless or Full version)
  * **UserLAnd**
  * **Termux + proot**
* Benefits:

  * Keep all phone features
  * Get access to most Linux/Kali tools
  * No risk of bricking like flashing a whole new OS

---

### **3. Experimental / Not Fully Working**

* **PostmarketOS**, **Ubuntu Touch**, or **PureOS** would require a **full port** for the A32 (none exists right now).
* Even if you somehow ported them, things like mobile data and cameras would probably be broken.

---

### **Bottom Line**

Right now, your realistic daily-driver options for the A32 are:

1. Stock Samsung firmware
2. A custom Android ROM (if available for your variant)
3. Android + Linux in a chroot/VM (NetHunter, UserLAnd)
