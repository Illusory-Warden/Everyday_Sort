* (B): “It’s your birthday.”
* (C): “There will be a cake.”
* (P): “There is a party.”

Then the sentence “It’s your birthday **or** there will be a cake, **then** there is a party” translates to the implication:

[
(B \lor C) \to P
]

### Equivalent forms

* Using implication-as-disjunction:
  [
  (B \lor C) \to P \equiv \lnot(B \lor C)\ \lor\ P
  ]
  which by De Morgan is
  [
  (\lnot B \land \lnot C)\ \lor\ P.
  ]

* Contrapositive (logically equivalent):
  [
  \lnot P \to (\lnot B \land \lnot C).
  ]

### Useful inferences

* If you know (B) is true, then (B \lor C) is true, and by modus ponens you get (P).
  (So: if it *is* your birthday, there must be a party.)
* If (\lnot P) is true (no party), contrapositive tells you both (\lnot B) and (\lnot C) must hold (not your birthday and no cake).
