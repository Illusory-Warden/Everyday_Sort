### 🟩 **Power Factor (PF)**

It is the ratio of **active power (kW)** to **apparent power (kVA)**:

[
\text{Power Factor} = \cos\phi = \frac{kW}{kVA}
]

It indicates how efficiently electrical power is being converted into useful work.

### 🟦 **Load Power Factor**

This specifically refers to the **power factor of the load connected to the system**.

Examples of loads:
✔ Motors
✔ Heaters
✔ Transformers
✔ Industrial machinery

So,

[
\text{Load Power Factor} = \text{Power factor of the consuming load}
]

### 🟨 Conclusion

| Term                  | Meaning                  | Difference    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Power Factor**      | General term for kW/kVA  | Common word   |
| **Load Power Factor** | PF of the connected load | More specific |

### 💬 So yes, they are same → **PF = Load PF**
