### What is **MCP Server** on GitHub?

There are a few things "MCP Server" could refer to, depending on the context. Let's go over the likely meanings:

---

## üîß 1. **MCP = Minecraft Coder Pack**

**Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP)** was a set of tools used to **decompile and deobfuscate Minecraft Java Edition** source code. It was widely used for modding before tools like Forge and Fabric took over.

However, MCP **is not a server** by itself. It‚Äôs more of a toolset for mod developers.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. **MCP Server** Might Refer to a Forked or Custom Server Built with MCP

Some mod developers use MCP to:

* Reverse-engineer Minecraft server code
* Build **custom Minecraft servers** or tools
* Host them on GitHub under the name "MCP Server"

In these cases, "MCP Server" could be:

* A custom Minecraft Java server built using MCP
* A modded server project based on decompiled code
* A server-compatible modding framework
