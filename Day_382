The one in your screenshot is **Cronlytic Trigger**, which is an external integration for advanced cron scheduling (requires Cronlytic service).

The one you want for this workflow is the **built-in Cron node** that comes with n8n by default. It looks like this:

* Name: **Cron**
* Icon: A little clock ⏰
* Purpose: Triggers the workflow at a fixed interval or schedule (daily, hourly, custom).

👉 To find it: In your node search, just type **“Cron”** (not Cronlytic).
That’s the one you’ll use to run your weather email at 7 AM every day.
