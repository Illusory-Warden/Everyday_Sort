### Step 1: Define the propositions

Let:

* **C** = “I will go to class.”
* **U** = “You come.”

---

### Step 2: Understand the sentence

> “I will not go to class unless you come.”

“Unless” can be tricky in logic!
The phrase **‘A unless B’** means **‘If not B, then not A’** — or equivalently, **‘If A, then B.’**

So here:

> “I will not go to class unless you come”
> means
> “If you do not come, then I will not go to class.”

---

### Step 3: Write that in symbols

“If not U, then not C” →
[
\neg U \rightarrow \neg C
]

---

### Step 4 (Equivalent form):

You can also express it as
[
C \rightarrow U
]
which reads: “If I go to class, then you come.”

Both are logically equivalent.

✅ **Final logical formula:**
[
\boxed{\neg U \rightarrow \neg C}
]
or equivalently
[
\boxed{C \rightarrow U}
]
