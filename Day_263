Resolver error: Error: Remote - SSH is only supported in Microsoft versions of VS Code
```

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **You’re using VSCodium** – this is the open-source build of VS Code, not the official Microsoft build.
2. **The Remote - SSH extension** (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh`) is checking the VS Code build and refuses to run if it’s not the official Microsoft version. That’s why the connection is failing immediately.
3. All the other log lines (SSH config, ports, etc.) are standard debug info, but the actual failure is due to the extension itself blocking non-Microsoft builds.

✅ **In short:** Remote-SSH won’t work in VSCodium because the extension is designed to run only in the official VS Code.

### Options to fix this:

1. **Use official VS Code**

   * Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the Remote-SSH extension there. Everything should work.

2. **Use VSCodium with a patched version of the extension** (less straightforward)

   * Some people have forked Remote-SSH to work on VSCodium, but it requires manual installation and can be tricky.

3. **Use plain SSH in the terminal**

   * You can always connect via `ssh warden` in your terminal and then use VS Code’s **Remote Development via SSH in official VS Code**, or just work in the terminal directly.
