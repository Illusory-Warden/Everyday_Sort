### **Slide 1: Introduction to Behavioral Economics**

**Script:**

"Good morning everyone. Today I’ll be talking about *Gains and Losses in Behavioral Economics.*

Let’s begin with what behavioral economics is. It’s an area that combines economics with psychology to understand how people *actually* make decisions — which often isn't as rational as traditional economics would suggest.

Classical economics assumes that people are perfectly rational and always try to maximize their utility. But in real life, our decisions are influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and even social pressures.

Behavioral economics helps us explain those deviations from rational behavior and gives us a more realistic understanding of how people behave in economic scenarios."

### **Slide 2: Understanding Gains and Losses**

**Script:**

"In behavioral economics, gains and losses are not measured in absolute terms — they're measured *relative to a reference point.*

This reference point could be your current situation, expectations, or even someone else's status. What matters is not whether you gained or lost in total, but how that outcome compares to what you were expecting.

For example, earning \$50 may feel like a gain if you expected \$30, but like a loss if you expected \$100.

There’s also an interesting aspect shown in utility curves. For gains, the increase in happiness gets smaller as you gain more — that’s called diminishing marginal utility. But losses are different — the pain of losing is often *more intense* than the pleasure of an equivalent gain."

---

### **Slide 3: Loss Aversion**

**Script:**

"This leads us to a core concept called *loss aversion.*

Loss aversion means that people feel the pain of losing much more strongly than they feel the pleasure of gaining the same amount.

Think about it: losing \$100 feels worse than gaining \$100 feels good. This affects many of our decisions, especially when risk is involved.

It helps explain why people avoid selling stocks that are losing value — they don’t want to ‘realize’ the loss. Or why we’re more likely to choose options that avoid losses than those that promise gains."

### **Slide 4: Prospect Theory Overview**

**Script:**

"*Prospect Theory*, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, builds on these ideas to describe how we make decisions under risk.

It challenges the old idea of expected utility theory by introducing three key concepts:

* First, *reference dependence* — people view outcomes as gains or losses relative to a starting point.
* Second, *diminishing sensitivity* — as the size of a gain or loss increases, our emotional reaction gets weaker.
* Third, *loss aversion* — again, losses hurt more than gains feel good.

This theory gives us a better model of real-world decision-making, especially under uncertainty."

### **Slide 5: Real-Life Applications: Marketing**

**Script:**

"These concepts aren’t just theoretical — they’re used in real life, especially in *marketing.*

Marketers carefully frame offers as either gains or losses depending on what will be more persuasive.

A *gain frame* might say, 'Save ₹200 when you buy today' — this emphasizes a benefit.

But a *loss frame* might say, 'Don’t miss out on ₹200 savings' — which creates a fear of missing out, and that tends to be more motivating.

By understanding how people respond differently to gains and losses, marketers can craft messages that influence buying decisions more effectively."

### **Slide 6: Real-Life Applications: Public Policy**

**Script:**

"Framing is also used by governments and policymakers — especially when trying to influence public behavior.

Take taxes, for example.

If a notice says you’ll *lose* money due to penalties if you pay late, that’s a *loss frame*, and it encourages faster compliance.

On the other hand, saying you’ll get a *discount* if you pay early is a *gain frame*. Both messages communicate the same outcome, but they trigger very different responses.

This is how behavioral economics helps shape better public policy."

### **Slide 7: Case Study – Energy Conservation Programs**

**Script:**

"Here’s a real-life example of how framing affects behavior.

In energy conservation campaigns, utility companies tested two types of messages:

* One said, 'You saved 10% on your energy bill' — that’s a gain frame.
* The other said, 'You wasted 10% more energy than your neighbors' — that’s a loss frame.

The results? The *loss-framed* message was much more effective. People responded more strongly to the idea of wasting energy than to saving it.

This shows how behavioral economics can drive real-world change — just by changing how we present information."

### **Slide 8: Criticism and Limitations**

**Script:**

"While these ideas are powerful, they’re not perfect.

One limitation is *cultural variability* — what works in one country might not work in another.

Also, the *context* matters. Some people might respond differently depending on their personality or situation.

There are also *ethical concerns* — is it okay to ‘nudge’ people using psychological tricks? Where do we draw the line between influence and manipulation?

So, while behavioral economics provides valuable tools, it’s important to use them responsibly."

---

### **Slide 9: Conclusion – The Power of Perspective**

**Script:**

"To wrap up — behavioral economics gives us insights into how people really make decisions.

It shows that people are more motivated to *avoid losses* than to gain the same value.

Marketers, governments, and businesses use this understanding — through framing and loss aversion — to shape behavior.

And as consumers or citizens, being aware of these influences helps us think more critically about the choices we make.

Thank you for listening!"
