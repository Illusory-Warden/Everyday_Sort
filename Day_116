✅ Fix: Create a Symlink with the Expected Name

Rather than renaming the folder (which might break the theme's internal references), you can create a **symlink** (shortcut) so both names work.

### 🛠️ Run this in the terminal:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/share/icons/Windows-10 /usr/share/icons/Windoes-10-icons
```

This tells Parrot OS:

> “Hey, here’s your ‘Windoes-10-icons’ theme... it just happens to point to the actual `Windows-10` folder.”

---

### 🔁 Then:

1. Reapply the **Windows 10 Dark** theme from your Appearance/Theme settings.
2. Log out and back in (or reboot) to fully refresh.
3. **The warning should now disappear. ✅**
