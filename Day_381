### **Mode**

* **Every Day**

### **Values**

* **Hour** → `7`
* **Minute** → `0`

That means the workflow will fire every day at **07:00** in your server’s timezone (or whatever timezone your n8n instance is set to).

⚡ If you want more flexibility (like only weekdays, or twice a day), you can switch to **Custom mode** and use standard cron syntax. For example:

* `0 7 * * *` → every day at 07:00
* `0 7,19 * * *` → at 07:00 and 19:00 daily
* `0 7 * * 1-5` → weekdays at 07:00
