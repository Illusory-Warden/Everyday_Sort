🧭 Basic Principles of Documentation
Here are the key principles:

Clarity

Write clearly and simply so anyone can understand the content.

Avoid jargon unless necessary—and explain it when you use it.

Accuracy

Information must be correct and updated.

Double-check facts, numbers, and processes.

Consistency

Use consistent formatting, tone, terminology, and structure.

Follow style guides if you're part of a team or organization.

Completeness

Include all necessary details so someone unfamiliar with the topic can follow along.

Conciseness

Be brief but informative—avoid fluff and repetition.

Accessibility

Ensure it's easy to find, navigate, and understand.

Use headings, indexes, hyperlinks, and visuals to enhance usability.

Purpose-Driven

Know the goal: Is it for training, troubleshooting, knowledge sharing, or compliance?

Version Control

Keep track of edits and updates, especially in technical or collaborative work.
