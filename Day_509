We’ll go through Unit n step-by-step, topic by topic, in a clear exam-oriented way.
Here’s how we’ll proceed:
1. You will tell me the first topic you want to study.
2. I will explain it in a simple, structured, exam-focused manner with:
Definition
Key points
Examples (if needed)
Short notes (good for writing answers)
3. After you understand, you can say “Next topic”, and we’ll move forward in sequence.
