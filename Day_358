Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?
Invalid permissions, or the requested model was not found.
```

This is almost always related to **credentials or permissions** issues. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to fix it:

---

### 1. **Check your Airtable API key**

* Make sure the API key you are using in n8n is **valid and active**.
* In n8n, go to **Credentials → Airtable API** and verify that the key matches the one in your Airtable account under [https://airtable.com/account](https://airtable.com/account).

---

### 2. **Check the Base ID and Table Name**

* Ensure you are referencing the **correct base** and **table name** in the node.
* Airtable is case-sensitive. Even a small typo in the table name or Base ID can cause a 403.

---

### 3. **Check permissions for the API key**

* Make sure the API key has **write access** to the table you are trying to create a record in.
* If it’s a **shared API key**, ensure it hasn’t been restricted or revoked.

---

### 4. **Confirm the Airtable API version**

* Some older nodes may use an outdated Airtable API version.
* Using the **latest n8n Airtable V2 node** (as your logs indicate) is good, but double-check your workspace supports it.

---

### 5. **Test the API Key externally**

* Use a tool like **Postman** or `curl` to test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -v https://api.airtable.com/v0/YOUR_BASE_ID/YOUR_TABLE_NAME \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

* If this returns `403 Forbidden`, the issue is with your API key or permissions, not n8n.

---

### 6. **Recreate credentials in n8n**

* Sometimes credentials stored in n8n get corrupted.
* Delete the existing Airtable credentials and **recreate them from scratch**, then reconnect the node.

---

### 7. **Check n8n version**

* Ensure you are on a **recent version of n8n Cloud** or self-hosted.
* Older versions might have bugs or deprecated integrations.

---

✅ **Summary:**
This error is **not a bug in n8n**, it’s **either your API key, permissions, Base ID, or table name**. Double-check each of these carefully. Most 403s in Airtable are caused by either a typo in the table name/Base ID or an API key without write access.
