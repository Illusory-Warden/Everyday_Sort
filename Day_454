### 🧾 **Bottom Line:**

Yes — **L&T Technology Services (LTTS)** **does provide internship opportunities** through **TECHgium**,
but they are **not guaranteed for everyone**.

---

### ⚙️ **How it actually works:**

* **Top-performing teams** (usually winners, runners-up, or shortlisted finalists)
  are **considered for internships or pre-placement offers (PPOs)** at LTTS.
* **Internships are offered selectively**, based on how good your idea is, your performance during presentations, and LTTS’s project interest.
* The event is used as an **avenue to identify talent** — meaning they use TECHgium to **spot skilled students** and offer them internships or jobs.

---

### 💡 In short:

> 🔹 **Yes, internships are offered — but only to selected or top teams**, not all participants.
> 🔹 **If your project stands out**, there’s a **real chance** to get an **internship or even a PPO** at LTTS.
