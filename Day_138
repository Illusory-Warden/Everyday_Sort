### 🧾 **What is `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`?**

This is a **configuration file** for **LightDM**, which is a **login display manager** used in many Linux distributions—including **Parrot OS**—to handle the graphical login screen (GUI login).

It controls things like:

* What greeter (login screen) to use
* Whether to enable auto-login
* Default user session (Xfce, MATE, etc.)
* Timeout before login
* Language and accessibility options

### 💡 **Why do you get the "modified by you or a script" message?**

When **updating** your system, if the update includes a **new version** of a config file, and the one on your system is **different from the default**, the system detects this and asks:

> “Do you want to replace your custom config with the new one?”

This avoids **accidentally erasing your customizations**.

---

### 🧠 How does this happen?

The system compares:

* The **original default file** from when the package was first installed
* Your **current file** (which may be changed)
* The **new default file** from the update

If it sees a difference, it stops and asks you what to do.

---

### 📌 Summary:

You're being asked:

* Do you want to keep your version (which may be customized)?
* Or replace it with the new, possibly improved, default version?

This is **normal** in Linux and helps prevent updates from breaking your system or overwriting your changes.
