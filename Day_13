Parrot OS, a security-focused Linux distribution, comes with a variety of network monitoring tools designed for penetration testing, security auditing, and digital forensics. Here are some key tools available in Parrot OS for network monitoring:

### **1. Wireshark**
   - A powerful packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting and security analysis.
   - Allows capturing and inspecting packets in real-time.

### **2. Nmap (Network Mapper)**
   - A popular open-source network scanner.
   - Used for network discovery, vulnerability scanning, and host detection.
   - Supports advanced scanning techniques such as SYN scans, OS detection, and service fingerprinting.

### **3. Zenmap**
   - A graphical frontend for Nmap.
   - Provides a more user-friendly interface for network scanning and mapping.

### **4. Netdiscover**
   - An active/passive network reconnaissance tool.
   - Primarily used for discovering hosts on a local subnet.

### **5. EtherApe**
   - A graphical network traffic monitoring tool.
   - Displays network traffic in real-time with color-coded connections.

### **6. TCPDump**
   - A command-line packet analyzer.
   - Useful for network debugging and capturing packets for later analysis.

### **7. IPTraf-NG**
   - A console-based network monitoring tool.
   - Provides real-time network statistics such as IP traffic, packet size, and protocol breakdown.

### **8. Angry IP Scanner**
   - A fast and simple network scanning tool.
   - Used for detecting live hosts and open ports.

### **9. ARPwatch**
   - Monitors ARP traffic and detects ARP spoofing or poisoning attacks.
   - Logs MAC address changes on the network.

### **10. ntopng**
   - A web-based network traffic analyzer.
   - Provides detailed insights into network traffic, bandwidth usage, and security threats.

### **11. WiFi-Pumpkin**
   - A wireless network auditing framework.
   - Used for creating rogue access points and testing network security.

### **12. Bettercap**
   - A powerful tool for network reconnaissance and penetration testing.
   - Supports MITM attacks, packet manipulation, and credential sniffing.

### **13. Hping3**
   - A network tool for packet generation and response analysis.
   - Can be used for network mapping, security auditing, and DoS attack simulation.

### **14. Driftnet**
   - A tool that captures and displays images transmitted over a network.
   - Useful for analyzing unencrypted HTTP traffic.

### **15. NetHogs**
   - A bandwidth monitoring tool that displays real-time per-process network usage.
   - Helps in identifying which processes are consuming network resources.

### **16. Snort**
   - A network intrusion detection system (NIDS).
   - Monitors traffic and detects malicious activities using rule-based signatures.

### **17. Suricata**
   - An advanced NIDS with multi-threaded capabilities.
   - Offers high-speed packet inspection and deep packet analysis.

These tools collectively help in monitoring, analyzing, and securing networks from potential threats. Do you need recommendations on how to use any specific tool?
