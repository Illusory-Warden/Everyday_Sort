## 🚨 Problem Statement

India's legal system faces significant challenges that prevent millions from accessing justice:

- **📊 Massive Case Backlog**: Over 4 crore (40 million) pending cases
- **📚 Low Legal Awareness**: 90% of citizens don't know their rights
- **🌐 Language Barriers**: Legal help rarely available in regional languages
- **💰 High Costs**: Legal services unaffordable for low-income families
- **😰 Fear & Mistrust**: People avoid police and courts due to intimidation
- **🔍 Complex Procedures**: Legal processes are difficult to understand
- **🏘️ Limited Access**: Few legal resources available in rural areas

These barriers disproportionately affect rural communities, leaving millions with unresolved issues like land disputes, domestic violence, labor abuse, and pension denial.
