### üîç What‚Äôs Happening with Your Ashok Leyland Stock?

From your screenshot and what you've said:

* You received **20 bonus shares** on a base of **20 original shares**, so this is a **1:1 bonus issue**.
* This is **not a stock split**, though both events increase the number of shares you hold.

### üÜö Bonus Issue vs Stock Split:

| **Aspect**          | **Bonus Issue**                          | **Stock Split**                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Free shares given by the company         | Division of existing shares into more units |
| **Example**         | 1:1 bonus = 1 extra share per share held | 1:2 split = 1 share becomes 2 shares        |
| **Face Value**      | Remains the same                         | Face value is reduced (e.g., ‚Çπ10 ‚Üí ‚Çπ5)      |
| **Market Cap**      | No change                                | No change                                   |
| **Share Price**     | Adjusts accordingly                      | Adjusts accordingly                         |
| **Tax Implication** | Bonus shares have **zero cost**          | Original cost gets split between new shares |

### ‚úÖ So, Your Case = **Bonus Issue**, Not Stock Split

Ashok Leyland recently declared a **bonus issue** (you can confirm this via their corporate announcements or news). That‚Äôs why your account shows **20 bonus shares** that will be **tradable after 31 July 2025**.
