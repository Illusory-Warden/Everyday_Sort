If you add a small amount of plain yogurt (with **live active cultures**) to warm milk, the bacteria in the yogurt (mostly *Lactobacillus bulgaricus* and *Streptococcus thermophilus*) will ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. This acid thickens the milk proteins and gives yogurt its tangy flavor.

A few important points if you want it to work:

* **Temperature matters:** Heat the milk first (around 80–90 °C / 176–194 °F) to denature proteins, then cool it to about 40–45 °C (104–113 °F). Too hot kills the bacteria; too cold and fermentation is slow or fails.
* **Starter yogurt:** The yogurt you add must contain *live* cultures (check the label). Flavored yogurts often don’t work well.
* **Time:** Once inoculated, keep the mixture warm (around 40–45 °C) for 4–12 hours until it thickens.
* **Cleanliness:** Use clean utensils and containers to prevent unwanted bacteria from taking over.

So yes — a spoonful of yogurt in milk *can* make more yogurt, but only under the right conditions.
