Here’s how to **undo** what you did with
`git add .` (i.e., you added files to the staging area but haven’t committed yet).

---

### 🧭 Scenario 1: You only ran `git add .` (no commit yet)

To **unstage all files**, run:

```bash
git reset
```

✅ This will unstage everything you just added — your working directory (the actual files) will remain unchanged.

If you want to unstage a specific file:

```bash
git reset <filename>
```

---

### 🧭 Scenario 2: You also want to discard file changes completely

If you want to **discard changes** (go back to how the files were in the last commit):

```bash
git restore .
```

⚠️ This will delete all modifications you made after the last commit.
