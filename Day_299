## ðŸ”¹ What we have already covered in this chat:

* **Time & Space Complexity basics** (O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n log n), etc.)
* **Best case, worst case, average case idea** (e.g., we talked about best case for $5n^2$ being Î˜(nÂ²))
* **Asymptotic bounds examples** (finding O, Î©, Î˜ for $2n+5$, including constants $c_1, c_2$)
* **Cost analysis of code** (sum of array with a for loop â†’ exact cost, total = 3n+4 â†’ O(n))
* **Algorithmic design principles** (Divide & Conquer, Greedy, DP, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ What we have **not fully formalized yet:**

* A **formal introduction of the 3 Asymptotic Notations**:

  * **Big-O (O)** â†’ upper bound
  * **Big-Omega (Î©)** â†’ lower bound
  * **Big-Theta (Î˜)** â†’ tight bound
* Their **properties** (transitivity, reflexivity, addition rule, multiplication rule, etc.).
* A **clear definition of best case, worst case, and average case analysis** in terms of these notations.
