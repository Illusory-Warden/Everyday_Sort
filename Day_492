### 🧠 Step 1: Fit with Conference Themes

IC-DECoN 2025 has multiple tracks, and your topic fits **very naturally** into several of them:

| **Track**                                                                                             | **Relevance to Your Paper**                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**                                                          | Your system uses AI — that’s a perfect thematic fit.                                                     |
| **Smart Analytics and Machine Learning**                                                              | If you use predictive models for adaptive learning, recommendation systems, etc., this applies directly. |
| **Computing & Communication Technologies**                                                            | If your platform uses cloud/web architecture, or online delivery, it fits.                               |
| **Innovation in Education Systems (possibly under interdisciplinary or emerging technologies track)** | Even though not a major listed track, AI in education is generally accepted under “AI applications.”     |

✅ **Verdict:** Your paper **fits well** under the **AI / Data Science / Machine Learning** track.
Be sure to emphasize **technical innovation** — not just “a product idea,” but what is new in your algorithm, data processing, or adaptive system.

### 🧩 Step 2: What Kind of Papers They’re Looking For

From the IC-DECoN 2025 call for papers:

* **Type:** Original, unpublished research.
* **Length:** Up to 6 pages (IEEE format).
* **Focus:** Strong technical content — algorithms, implementation, or experimental results.
  (Conceptual or survey papers are less favored unless they have clear novelty.)
* **Template:** IEEE conference template (Word or LaTeX).
* **Evaluation:** Papers are reviewed for novelty, technical quality, clarity, and relevance.

### 📘 Step 3: How to Position Your Paper

For **“Skill Pilot: An AI-powered education platform,”** here’s how you can structure it to meet IEEE expectations:

| **Section**                               | **What to Emphasize**                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstract & Keywords**                   | Concise summary; use technical keywords: “adaptive learning,” “AI recommender,” “personalized education,” etc.             |
| **Introduction**                          | The problem in education technology — skill gaps, personalization challenges, and how AI can help.                         |
| **Related Work**                          | Review other AI education platforms (e.g., Coursera’s AI recommenders, Duolingo’s ML models) and explain what’s missing.   |
| **Proposed Method / System Architecture** | Show your **AI model**, architecture (backend, algorithms), or **workflow diagram**. Include flowcharts or block diagrams. |
| **Experiment / Evaluation**               | Metrics: accuracy, user engagement, time reduction, or learning effectiveness.                                             |
| **Results & Discussion**                  | Quantitative or qualitative results. Even small pilot user testing is valuable.                                            |
| **Conclusion & Future Work**              | What’s next (scaling, adaptive features, integrating with LMS, etc.)                                                       |

### 🎓 Step 4: How “Strong” This Paper Could Be for This Conference

Since IC-DECoN accepts **AI-based applied systems**, your topic is a **very good match** — especially if:

* You include a working prototype or experiment (not just concept).
* You use ML/NLP models for recommendations or assessment.
* You clearly show *technical novelty*, not just interface design.

If done well, you could even win a **Best Paper Award** in the AI track.

### ⚠️ Step 5: Reputation and Strategic Advice

IC-DECoN 2025 is **credible but regional** — suitable for:

* **Students and early-career researchers** publishing their first AI system.
* Papers aiming for **IEEE Xplore visibility**, though not necessarily global high-impact recognition.

If your long-term goal is **PhD applications, IEEE membership recognition, or industry exposure**, this is a **good entry-level conference** to build your record.

If your goal is **a top-tier publication (like AAAI, NeurIPS, or IEEE Transactions journals)**, this one is **a step below that tier** — but a valid start.
