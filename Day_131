    Step 17.9: Confirm that your shared folder appears correctly in the list.<br><br>

    🔹Breakdown:<br>
    -----Once saved, your new shared folder (e.g., <code>NAS</code>) should now appear in the <b>Shared Folders</b> list.<br>
    -----It will show details like <b>Name</b>, <b>Device</b>, <b>Relative Path</b>, and more.<br>
    -----Refer to the image provided to verify your folder looks similar.<br><br>

    💡 Make sure the folder appears exactly as configured. If not, go back and double-check the name, path, and selected disk. ✔️🗂️<br><br>

    ⚠️ Follow the next steps carefully — this folder will be used for all your shared network storage!
