## ✅ Step-by-Step: What to Do Next

### 1. **Confirm Paperless-ngx is Running**

Run:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see at least these containers running:

* `compose-webserver-1` → Paperless app
* `compose-db-1` → PostgreSQL
* `compose-broker-1` → Redis

If they're **"Up"**, you're good.

### 2. **Get Your IP Address (for Browser Access)**

Run:

```bash
ip a | grep inet
```

Look for your LAN IP — something like:

```
inet 192.168.x.x
or
inet 10.0.2.x
```

That’s your server's IP.

### 3. **Open Paperless in Your Browser**

From your current machine or any device on the same network:

> 🌐 Open:
> **`http://<your-ip>:8000`**
> Example: `http://10.0.2.4:8000`

### 4. **Login with Default Admin Credentials**

Default credentials from `.env`:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

> ✅ You’ll be prompted to change the password after first login.
