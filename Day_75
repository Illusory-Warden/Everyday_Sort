## 📘 **1. Basic Principle**

**AC-AC Converters** are power electronic devices that **convert AC voltage of one magnitude to AC voltage of another magnitude** **without changing the frequency** (in most basic types). These converters are also known as **AC Voltage Controllers**.

---

### 🔌 **Definition:**

> AC-AC converters are devices that control the output **RMS voltage** of an alternating current (AC) supply by **controlling the firing angle** of semiconductor switches like **SCRs or TRIACs**.

---

### 🧱 **Types of AC-AC Converters:**

| Type                        | Output Type           | Frequency |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| AC Voltage Controller       | AC → AC (same freq.)  | Unchanged |
| Cycloconverter              | AC → AC (lower freq.) | Changed   |
| Matrix Converter (advanced) | AC → AC (var freq.)   | Changed   |

In your syllabus, we are focusing on **AC Voltage Controllers** (i.e., output voltage control at same input frequency).

### 🧩 **Where is it used?**

* **Light dimmers**
* **Fan speed control**
* **Industrial heater control**
* **AC motor speed control**

## ⚙️ **2. Operation of AC Voltage Controller (AC-AC Converter)**

There are **two main operating methods**:

---

### 🔹 a) **Phase Control Method**

* AC voltage is applied for a **part of the cycle only**.
* SCRs/triacs are turned **ON at a certain firing angle α**.
* Controls output voltage by **cutting off a portion of the waveform**.

#### 🔁 Modes:

| Mode                  | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Half-Wave Control** | Only one half of input waveform is used      |
| **Full-Wave Control** | Both halves are used using two SCRs or TRIAC |

#### 🔧 Example:

* Firing angle α = 90° ⇒ Output voltage starts after 90° ⇒ RMS voltage is lower.

---

### 🔹 b) **ON-OFF Control Method**

* The entire **input waveform is passed or blocked** for a few cycles.
* No waveform chopping per cycle; just full cycles passed/blocked.
* Slower control compared to phase control.

| Comparison          | Phase Control        | ON-OFF Control                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Control             | Per cycle            | Per group of cycles           |
| Switching Frequency | High                 | Low                           |
| Output Quality      | Poorer (harmonics)   | Smoother for slow processes   |
| Application         | Motor speed, dimmers | Heaters, slow thermal systems |

### ⚡ **Waveform Behavior in Phase Control:**

Let’s say you have a 230 V AC input:

* **If α = 0°:** Output = full sine wave
* **If α = 90°:** Output starts halfway → Lower RMS value
* **If α = 150°:** Even lower output

**RMS Output Voltage:**

For resistive load:

$$
V_{rms} = V_m \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\alpha}^{\pi} \sin^2(\omega t) \, d(\omega t)}
$$

(You usually don't need to derive it in exams unless asked.)

## 🧪 **Example Use-Case: Fan Regulator**

* TRIAC based regulator.
* Adjusts firing angle based on the knob.
* Controls RMS voltage sent to fan motor ⇒ adjusts speed.
