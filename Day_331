## 🔎 IEEE Format Compliance (Page 1)

1. **Title**

   * ✅ Clear, descriptive title.
   * ⚠️ IEEE format usually uses **Title Case** and centered formatting in bold. Currently it looks like plain text.

2. **Authors & Affiliations**

   * ✅ Authors are listed with affiliation.
   * ⚠️ In IEEE format, affiliations should follow the style: *Author Name, Affiliation, City, Country, Email*. Currently, emails are missing and department formatting is inconsistent.

3. **Abstract**

   * ✅ Structured, contains problem, methodology, evaluation, results, and significance.
   * ⚠️ Formatting: In IEEE style, “Abstract” should be centered and bold, followed by the abstract text in a block (not “Abstract-” with a hyphen).

4. **Keywords**

   * ✅ Keywords are provided.
   * ⚠️ IEEE requires keywords after the abstract in *italicized "Index Terms—"* style. Example: *Index Terms—Raspberry Pi, Personal Cloud, Data Sovereignty*.

5. **Introduction**

   * ✅ Starts right after keywords.
   * ⚠️ IEEE style prefers **Roman numeral headings (I. INTRODUCTION, II. RELATED WORK, etc.)**. Here, “I INTRODUCTION” is missing the period (should be “I. INTRODUCTION”).

## 🚨 Potential Warnings (Content & Style Issues)

* **Overly Long Abstract**: At \~300+ words, it exceeds IEEE’s typical limit (\~150–250 words). Risk of rejection.
* **Too Many Keywords**: IEEE usually limits keywords to 4–6. You currently have 17.
* **Reference Style**: Some references are cited as `[1], [12]` etc., which is correct, but spacing and order should be checked (IEEE prefers `[1], [2]` not `[1], [12]` unless non-sequential).
* **Technical Density**: The abstract is very detail-heavy (specific HDD models, timings, ISP plan). IEEE abstracts should summarize key contributions/results, not implementation minutiae.

## ✍️ Suggested Edits (Page 1)

### Major Edits

1. **Reformat Title & Author Block**:

   * Example IEEE style:

     ```
     Pi-Vate Cloud: A Self-Sovereign, Cost-Effective Personal Data-Ecosystem on Raspberry Pi
     Rushi Daulatkar, Atharva Dhote, Abhijeet Pathode, Harsh Yadav, Prof. Renuka Raut  
     Dept. of Computer Science and Business Systems, St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur, India  
     Email: {email1, email2, …}@domain.com
     ```
2. **Abstract Simplification**:

   * Reduce word count, keep only **problem, method, results, conclusion**. Move detailed hardware specs, timings, and security steps into methodology/results sections.
3. **Keywords Reduction**:

   * Limit to 4–6 most important ones (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Personal Cloud, Data Sovereignty, OpenMediaVault, Nextcloud, Plex).

### Minor Edits

* Change **“Abstract-”** → **“Abstract—”** (em dash, per IEEE style).
* Replace **“Keywords-”** → **“Index Terms—”**.
* Change headings: “I INTRODUCTION” → **“I. INTRODUCTION”**.
* Watch grammar: e.g., “introduces recurring costs, privacy exposures, and vendor lock in” → should be **“vendor lock-in”**.
* Abstract: “empirical measurements include” → better phrased as **“We conducted empirical measurements including…”** for readability.
