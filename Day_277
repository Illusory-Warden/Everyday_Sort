Perfect! That's an **excellent** way to put it.

Yes, that sentence is exactly saying that. The getters and setters are the **public, secure gatekeepers**.

They provide a controlled, secret tunnel to the private data. They let approved information in and out, but they **don't reveal anything about the vault (the private field) on the other side.**

*   They don't leak the data's **real name** (the field could be called `model`, `mod`, or `m` internally).
*   They don't reveal **where it's stored** or **how it's handled** (the setter might clean the data before storing it, the getter might calculate it on the fly).

They just do their job silently and securely, protecting the private implementationâ€”exactly like a secret tunnel.
