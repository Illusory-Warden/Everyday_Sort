## **1. If Your Repo is Private**

* Since your repository is private, **you don‚Äôt strictly need a public open-source license**.
* You can continue using a **proprietary license** (like your current ‚ÄúAll Rights Reserved + NDA‚Äù) to control usage internally.
* Public licenses only matter if you plan to **share the repo externally** or make it open source.

## **3. Recommendation Based on Use Case**

* **If it‚Äôs code and you want maximum freedom for reuse:**
  ‚Üí **MIT License** (or BSD 2/3-Clause)

* **If you want others to share improvements back:**
  ‚Üí **GPL v3** (strong copyleft) or **MPL 2.0** (file-level copyleft)

* **If it‚Äôs documentation or research material:**
  ‚Üí **Creative Commons licenses** (e.g., **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** for non-commercial, no derivatives; CC0 for public domain dedication)

* **If it‚Äôs a mix of code + proprietary research (your current case):**
  ‚Üí Keep **proprietary + NDA** for confidential material
  ‚Üí Optionally, use **MIT** for any open-source code scripts
  ‚Üí Use **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** for documentation/educational content

---

üí° **Summary:**

For your case (private repo with research + some code):

* **Proprietary / NDA:** Confidential research
* **MIT License:** Technical scripts or code you may share internally or later publicly
* **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0:** Documentation and educational material
