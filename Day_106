✅ **Correct answer: 2001\:DB8:0:1111::200**

---

### Explanation:

Let's examine each option to determine which is a **valid IPv6 address**:

---

### ✅ **`2001:DB8:0:1111::200`**

* This is **valid**.
* `::` is used correctly to compress one or more groups of `0000`.
* The total number of segments is **no more than 8** when expanded.
* All hextets contain **valid hexadecimal characters** (0–9, A–F).

---

### ❌ **`2001:0DB8::ABCD::1234`**

* **Invalid**: An IPv6 address can only contain **one `::`**.
* This address contains **two `::`**, which is **not allowed**.

---

### ❌ **`ABCD:160D::4GAB:FFAB`**

* **Invalid**: `4GAB` contains the character **G**, which is **not valid in hexadecimal**.
* IPv6 hextets must only use **0–9 and A–F**.

---

### ❌ **`2001::ABCD::`**

* **Invalid**: Again, this has **two `::`**, which is not allowed.
* Only **one `::`** can be used in an IPv6 address to represent contiguous zero hextets.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**`2001:DB8:0:1111::200`** is the only **valid IPv6 notation** in the list.
