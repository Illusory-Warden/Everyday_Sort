| 2       | Hook: Why This Matters                       | An eye-catching fact or problem: “Why we needed blue light LEDs” or “Why this was thought impossible” | Person 1          |
| 3       | A Little History                             | Talk about red and green LEDs. Why blue was missing. Mention RCA’s 1972 try.                          | Person 2          |
| 4       | The Scientific Challenge                     | What made blue LEDs so hard to make? (Explain things like GaN material, wide bandgap, p-type doping)  | Person 2          |
