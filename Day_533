This error, `Error: Cannot find module 't\node_modules\vite\bin\vite.js'`, indicates that the **Vite package is missing or corrupted** in your project's `node_modules` directory.

The most common solution is to **reinstall your project's dependencies**.

Here is the step-by-step fix:

##  Solution: Reinstall Dependencies

Since you are using `pnpm`, run the following command in the **`\apps\papra-client`** directory:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Why this works:

1.  The `pnpm install` command will read the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.
2.  It will download and correctly place all necessary packages, including **Vite**, into the `node_modules` folder, fixing the missing file error.

### Next Step

After the installation completes successfully, try running your development script again:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

If the error persists, you might need to try a clean installation:

1.  **Delete** the `node_modules` folder and the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file within `\apps\papra-client`.
2.  Run `pnpm install` again.
