### Step 1: Assign propositions

Let:

* **P** = “He is poor”
* **H** = “He is honest”

---

### Step 2: Understand the connector

The word **“but”** in logic usually means the same as **“and” (∧)** — it just adds a contrast in English, not in logic.

So,

> “He is poor but he is honest”

means logically the same as

> “He is poor and he is honest.”

---

### ✅ Logical formula:

[
P \land H
]

---

If you wanted to show the **contrast** implied by “but” (though it’s not formal logic), you could write something like:
[
P \land H \text{ with implied contrast between } P \text{ and } H
]
—but in strict propositional logic, it’s simply **P ∧ H**.
