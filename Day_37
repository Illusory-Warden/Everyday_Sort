Title:
Investigating the Melting and Solidification Behavior of Metallic Alloys Using Microgravity-Based Electromagnetic Levitators

Abstract:
This research investigates the melting and solidification behavior of metallic alloys under microgravity conditions using electromagnetic levitation (EML) and electrostatic levitation (ESL) systems, primarily aboard the International Space Station (ISS). By eliminating the influence of container walls and gravitational settling, microgravity enables precise measurement of key thermophysical properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and thermal diffusivity. The study examines the extent of undercooling and solidification dynamics in alloys like Al-Ni and neodymium titanate, comparing space-based results to terrestrial findings. Enhanced control over solidification processes and contamination-free measurement offer valuable insights for both theoretical materials science and the development of advanced industrial casting and additive manufacturing techniques.

1. Introduction
Understanding the behavior of metallic alloys during phase transitions is critical for advancing materials design and manufacturing technologies. Terrestrial experiments are often limited by gravity-driven convection, sedimentation, and contamination from crucibles. Microgravity platforms, such as the ISS, provide a unique environment where these factors are minimized, allowing for containerless processing through levitation techniques. Electromagnetic levitation (EML) and electrostatic levitation (ESL) have emerged as key tools in space-based metallurgy, enabling high-fidelity investigations of melting, undercooling, and solidification phenomena.

2. Background & Literature Review
2.1. Previous Microgravity Experiments
Experiments such as TEMPUS (Tiegelfreies Elektromagnetisches Prozessieren Unter Schwerelosigkeit), EML (Electromagnetic Levitator), and ELF (Electrostatic Levitation Furnace) have laid the foundation for current research. TEMPUS, flown on Spacelab and other missions, revealed key thermophysical behaviors in undercooled metallic systems. The EML aboard the ISS continues this work with enhanced control and diagnostics, enabling long-duration studies.

2.2. Key Findings from ISS-Based Research
ISS-based EML studies have achieved undercooling of up to 20% below the melting point in metallic glass-forming alloys. Thermophysical properties measured in microgravity are significantly more accurate than ground-based counterparts. These findings have contributed to improved computational models for alloy solidification and crystallization kinetics.

3. Methodology
3.1. Sample Materials
This study focuses on aluminum-nickel (Al-Ni) alloys and neodymium titanate due to their industrial relevance and distinct solidification characteristics.

3.2. Levitation Techniques
Electromagnetic levitation was primarily used for conductive samples, allowing inductive heating and stable suspension. Electrostatic levitation was used for dielectric samples like oxides, where laser heating provides thermal control.

3.3. Measurement Tools
Advanced pyrometers, high-speed cameras, and onboard X-ray imaging systems were used to monitor temperature, surface oscillations, and solidification fronts. Temperature was precisely controlled with variable frequency inductive heating.

4. Results
4.1. Undercooling Behavior
Al-Ni samples exhibited deep undercooling levels up to 300 K, significantly higher than on Earth. Nucleation was delayed, enabling detailed analysis of the critical radius and solidification front velocities.

4.2. Thermophysical Properties
Surface tension and viscosity measurements showed temperature-dependent behavior consistent with molecular dynamic simulations. Thermal diffusivity was also determined with higher accuracy due to the absence of convective interference.

4.3. Microstructural Outcomes
Post-solidification analysis via electron microscopy revealed refined microstructures and suppressed dendritic growth in microgravity samples, attributed to uniform cooling and lack of buoyant forces.

5. Discussion
5.1. Comparison with Earth-Based Processing
Microgravity-processed samples displayed significantly different nucleation behavior and microstructures. The suppression of gravity-driven convection led to more uniform cooling rates and reduced segregation.

5.2. Benefits of Microgravity Environment
Containerless processing minimizes contamination, enabling intrinsic property measurement. The controlled environment supports the development of accurate solidification models and novel alloy formulations.

5.3. Scientific and Industrial Implications
Findings support advancements in casting, welding, and additive manufacturing processes. Improved data feeds back into simulations used in turbine blade design, electronic packaging, and aerospace component manufacturing.

6. Conclusion
This study confirms the advantages of using electromagnetic and electrostatic levitation under microgravity conditions to investigate the fundamental behaviors of metallic alloys during phase transitions. The enhanced data quality and novel insights gained aboard the ISS are contributing directly to both basic science and applied materials engineering. Future work should expand the range of alloys studied and integrate real-time in-situ monitoring systems for deeper insight into solidification dynamics.
