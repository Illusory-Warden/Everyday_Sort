In Nagpur, for standard black & white xerox/print (A4 size) the typical rates are approximately:

* Around **₹1 to ₹3 per page** for black & white copies. ([Justdial][1])
* Some bulk-discounted rates show as low as around **₹0.50 to ₹1 per side** in certain places. ([xerox wala][2])
* Double-sided copies might cost slightly more than single side. ([Scribd][3])

If you tell me the specific area/neighbourhood in Nagpur (e.g., near your college), I can check current shop-rates there for you.
