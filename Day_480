* **P** = “He is poor”
* **C** = “He is clever”
* **H** = “He is honest”

### Step 2: Understand the English sentence

> “It is false that he is poor or clever but not honest.”

Let’s rephrase in simpler logical English:

> It is **not true** that [(he is poor or clever) and (he is not honest)].

---

### Step 3: Build the inner part first

* “He is poor or clever” → ( P \lor C )
* “He is not honest” → ( \neg H )
* “(He is poor or clever) but not honest” → ( (P \lor C) \land \neg H )

### Step 4: Add the outer negation

“It is false that …” means we put a negation (¬) in front.

[
\neg[(P \lor C) \land \neg H]
]

### ✅ Final Logical Formula:

[
\boxed{\neg[(P \lor C) \land \neg H]}
]
