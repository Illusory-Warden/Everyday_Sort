```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### ✅ What it DOES

* Updates the package list (`apt update`)
* Upgrades **already-installed packages** *without*:

  * changing dependencies
  * removing packages
* Safe for running services (OMV, Plex, Docker won’t break)

### ❌ What it DOES NOT do

* ❌ Kernel & firmware upgrades (often skipped)
* ❌ OpenMediaVault core upgrades
* ❌ Docker container image updates
* ❌ Orphaned package cleanup
* ❌ Bootloader updates

Think of it as **“basic maintenance”**, not a full system refresh.

## What you should run NEXT (recommended order)

### 1️⃣ Finish the OS upgrade properly

```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

Why?

* Allows kernel + dependency changes
* Needed for real OS updates

Then clean up:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo apt autoclean
```

---

### 2️⃣ Update OpenMediaVault (CRITICAL)

```bash
sudo omv-upgrade
```

If OMV isn’t updated, the web UI can lag behind the system packages.

---

### 3️⃣ Reboot (don’t skip this)

```bash
sudo reboot
```

This applies:

* New kernel
* Updated system services
* OMV changes

---

### 4️⃣ Update Docker containers (Plex, etc.)

Go to your docker-compose folder and run:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker image prune -af
```

---

## ✅ Minimal “do it right” checklist

If you want the **short, correct version**, bookmark this:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo omv-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo reboot
```

Then update Docker containers.
