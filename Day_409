### ⚙️ 1. **Service Overview**

* **Description of the system or service** covered (e.g., web application, cloud service, API, database).
* **Scope** – what components or functionalities are included/excluded from uptime measurement.

**Example:**

> This SLA applies to the production environment of the company’s online platform, excluding scheduled maintenance periods and third-party network outages.

---

### 📈 2. **Uptime Definition and Measurement**

* **Definition of Uptime:** Typically expressed as the percentage of time the system is operational and accessible to users.
* **Measurement method:** How uptime is calculated and over what period (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
* **Formula:**
  [
  \text{Uptime %} = \left(1 - \frac{\text{Downtime}}{\text{Total Time}}\right) \times 100
  ]

**Example:**

> Uptime is measured monthly based on system monitoring data. Downtime is any period exceeding 5 consecutive minutes during which the system is unavailable.

---

### 🕒 3. **Target Uptime Levels**

Defines the expected uptime percentage — commonly known as the “nines” of availability.

| Uptime % | Downtime per Month | Downtime per Year |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------: |
| 99%      | ~7 hours           |        ~3.65 days |
| 99.9%    | ~43 minutes        |       ~8.76 hours |
| 99.99%   | ~4 minutes         |       ~52 minutes |
| 99.999%  | ~26 seconds        |        ~5 minutes |

**Example:**

> The system will maintain an uptime of at least **99.9% per calendar month**.

---

### 🧰 4. **Maintenance and Exclusions**

Specifies what **does not count** toward downtime.

**Common exclusions:**

* Scheduled maintenance (with prior notice)
* Force majeure events (natural disasters, war)
* Outages caused by user errors or third-party dependencies
* Emergency maintenance (with reasonable notice)

**Example:**

> Scheduled maintenance will not exceed 4 hours per month and will be communicated at least 48 hours in advance.

---

### 🚨 5. **Monitoring and Reporting**

* **Monitoring tools:** Which systems measure uptime (e.g., Pingdom, Datadog).
* **Reporting frequency:** How often reports are provided (e.g., monthly uptime report).
* **Access:** Whether the customer can view real-time status dashboards.

---

### 💸 6. **Penalties / Service Credits**

Defines **remedies** if uptime falls below target.

**Example:**

| Uptime Achieved | Service Credit |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| < 99.9%         | 10% credit     |
| < 99.5%         | 25% credit     |
| < 99%           | 50% credit     |

---

### 🤝 7. **Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Service Provider:** Responsible for maintaining system availability, monitoring, and communication.
* **Customer:** Responsible for network connectivity, account security, and providing accurate contact details.

---

### 📢 8. **Incident Management and Communication**

* **Notification process:** How users are informed of outages or maintenance.
* **Response and resolution times:** Target times for acknowledging and resolving incidents.

**Example:**

> Provider will acknowledge incidents within 30 minutes and provide hourly status updates until resolution.

---

### 📜 9. **Review and Revision**

* **SLA review frequency** (e.g., annually).
* **Change process** for updating uptime targets or exclusions.

---

### ✅ Example Summary

> **SLA for System Uptime:**
>
> * Target uptime: 99.9% per month
> * Measurement: Monitored continuously via Datadog
> * Exclusions: Scheduled maintenance, force majeure events
> * Reporting: Monthly uptime report via email
> * Service credits: 10–50% depending on uptime shortfall
