### 1. **IEEE Student Branch**

* A college can establish an **IEEE Student Branch** if it has enough IEEE student members (usually at least 12) and one **faculty advisor** who is an IEEE member.
* This allows the college to host IEEE events, workshops, hackathons, and conferences under the IEEE banner.
* The branch becomes part of IEEEâ€™s global student network, and the institution is officially recognized by IEEE.

### 2. **IEEE Organizational Membership / Institutional Membership**

* Some universities and research institutes register for **IEEE Organizational Memberships** (also called Institutional or Corporate Memberships).
* This gives the institution access to IEEE resources, digital library (IEEE Xplore), and sometimes discounted access to journals/conferences for students & faculty.

### 3. **IEEE Societies / MoUs with Colleges**

* Certain colleges/universities sign **MoUs with IEEE societies** (e.g., IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications Society).
* This can provide institutional benefits like research collaborations, faculty training, and special access to publications.
