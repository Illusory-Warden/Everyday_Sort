## üîç What Lovable supports now

* Lovable allows **GitHub integration / export of code** so your project‚Äôs code is versioned and portable. ([Lovable Documentation][1])
* In their FAQ, they explicitly ask ‚ÄúCan I export my project and host it elsewhere?‚Äù ‚Äî the answer is **yes**. ([Lovable Documentation][2])
* There are video tutorials that show step-by-step how to export source code from Lovable to download locally. ([YouTube][3])
* One video titled *‚ÄúHow to Download Website Files From Lovable?‚Äù* shows connecting to GitHub then downloading the files locally. ([YouTube][4])
* Also, a Chrome extension ‚ÄúLovable.dev Project Downloader ‚Äì Export as ZIP (One Click)‚Äù claims to let you export the full project as a ZIP without using GitHub. ([Chrome Stats][5])

| Step | What to do                                      | Notes / Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1    | **Connect your Lovable project to GitHub**      | In Lovable, look for ‚ÄúEdit Code‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúGitHub Integration‚Äù or ‚ÄúTransfer to Repository.‚Äù This pushes your project code (frontend, backend, assets) to a GitHub repo. ([Lovable Documentation][1])                                                     |
| 2    | **Clone or Download from GitHub**               | Once the project is in GitHub, go to that repo ‚Üí **Code** ‚Üí **Download ZIP** or clone (`git clone <repo-url>`).                                                                                                                                   |
| 3    | **Open/run locally**                            | Navigate into the project folder on your machine and install dependencies (e.g. `npm install` or similar) then run the dev server (e.g. `npm run dev` or `npm start`) depending on the stack. The video tutorials show doing this. ([YouTube][6]) |
| 4    | **(Optional) Use the ZIP downloader extension** | If you don‚Äôt want to go via GitHub, try the ‚Äúlovable.dev project downloader‚Äù extension which claims to let you export the entire project as ZIP directly from Lovable. ([Chrome Stats][5])                                                        |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to watch out for

* **Private project / permission restrictions**: Some export features may only work for projects that are public or when certain settings (like ‚Äúremix / export allowed‚Äù) are enabled.
* **Build configuration / environment variables**: When running locally, environment variables, API keys, or backend configurations might not be present by default ‚Äî you may need to set them up.
* **Missing files or assets**: Sometimes images, media, or static assets may not be included unless the export process includes them explicitly.
* **Extension risks**: The ZIP export Chrome extension is a third-party tool ‚Äî use caution, ensure it's from a reliable source, and check permissions before installing.
