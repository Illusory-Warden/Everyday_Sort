"MCB Server" on GitHub likely refers to a **Minecraft Bedrock Server** project, although without a specific repository name, there could be several interpretations. Let’s break it down:

### 1. **MCB = Minecraft Bedrock**

"MCB" commonly stands for **Minecraft Bedrock**, the version of Minecraft that's designed for mobile, console, and Windows 10 platforms (as opposed to the Java Edition).

* A **Minecraft Bedrock Server (MCB Server)** is a multiplayer server designed to host Bedrock Edition players.
* These servers are different from Java Edition servers in terms of plugins, mods, and technical setup.

### 2. **GitHub MCB Server Projects**
