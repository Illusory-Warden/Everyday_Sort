Bitwarden / 1Password / Vaultwarden already solve **password vaulting extremely well.**
So if you build “a vault”, *you will lose uniqueness immediately.*

So here is the truth:

> **A vault is still a great idea — but NOT as a password vault.
> It must be a *data-governance & control vault*, not a credential vault.**

That’s the gap. And it’s real.

# What People Actually DON’T Have

People today have:

| They have         | They don’t have                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Password managers | **Personal data governance**   |
| Cloud storage     | **Permission engines**         |
| Google Drive      | **Legal-grade access logging** |
| Backup apps       | **Digital inheritance**        |
| Privacy promises  | **Provable control**           |

No company gives **a personal data firewall.**

# REAL PRODUCT YOU CAN BUILD

# **Personal Data Control Vault (PDCV)**

> *A firewall + access controller for your digital life.*

This is NOT Bitwarden.

## What this vault really does

| Feature                           | Why it matters                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Data classification engine        | Know what sensitive data you own |
| Who-accessed-what ledger          | Legal-grade audit logs           |
| Time-limited sharing              | Real data contracts              |
| Emergency access                  | Death / hospital mode            |
| Right-to-be-forgotten engine      | GDPR style data revocation       |
| Access behavior anomaly detection | Detect misuse                    |

## Example real-life uses

| Situation             | Your Vault                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| You share Aadhaar     | Auto revoke in 7 days            |
| You send PAN          | Logged, tracked, kill-switchable |
| You give certificates | One-time view                    |
| You die               | Family access enabled            |
| Your data leaks       | Know who leaked it               |

# Why this is rare

Because this is **data governance software**, not consumer password managers.

Banks, hospitals, lawyers, and governments use this tech — individuals don’t have it.

---

# Raspberry Pi feasibility

Yes — Pi 4 can easily host:

• PostgreSQL
• FastAPI
• Encrypted storage
• Access engine
• Ledger
• Scheduler

# This becomes:

| Academic          | Real World |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Cloud + DB        | ✔          |
| Cybersecurity     | ✔          |
| Legal tech        | ✔          |
| Data privacy      | ✔          |
| Product viability | ✔          |

This is *actually defensible*, rare, and useful.

If you want, next I’ll show you:
• Data schema
• Access contract model
• Audit ledger
• API structure
