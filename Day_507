##  How it Handles Graph Types

### 1. Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is fundamentally designed for **directed, weighted graphs**.

* **Operation:** It processes each edge $(u, v)$ in a single direction and uses the weight $w(u, v)$ for relaxation:
    $$\text{dist}[v] = \min(\text{dist}[v], \text{dist}[u] + w(u, v))$$
* **Application:** It correctly finds the shortest path distance from the source to all other nodes and can detect **negative cycles** if they exist.

### 2. Undirected Graphs
The algorithm can be applied to an undirected graph by converting it into an equivalent directed graph.

* **Conversion:** For every undirected edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w$ in the original graph, you replace it with **two directed edges**:
    1.  A directed edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w$.
    2.  A directed edge $(v, u)$ with weight $w$.
* **Negative Cycles in Undirected Graphs:** You must be extremely careful if the undirected graph contains **negative-weight edges**.
    * If an undirected edge $(u, v)$ has a **negative weight** $w < 0$, the conversion creates a **negative cycle** of length 2: $u \to v \to u$ with a total weight of $w + w = 2w < 0$.
    * Since Bellman-Ford's primary job is to **detect and signal** a negative cycle, if you apply it to an undirected graph with any negative-weight edge, it will correctly identify a negative cycle (the $u \leftrightarrow v$ pair) and typically will **not** yield the true shortest path, as the path length can be infinitely decreased by traversing this two-edge cycle repeatedly.

**In summary:**

* **Positive/Zero Weights:** It works perfectly.
* **Negative Weights:** It works, but if a single negative edge exists in the undirected graph, it will immediately find a negative cycle (the two-edge cycle created by the conversion). For this reason, the **Dijkstra's algorithm** is usually preferred for undirected graphs with non-negative weights due to its superior efficiency.
