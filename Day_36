üï∞Ô∏è Evolution of Data Storage Devices
1. Punch Cards (Late 1800s ‚Äì 1970s)
How it worked: Paper cards with holes punched in specific patterns to represent data.

Used in: Early computers, like IBM machines.

Capacity: Very limited (a few bytes per card).

Speed: Extremely slow.

Durability: Prone to physical damage and wear.

Use case: Basic data input/output, programming.

2. Magnetic Tape (1950s ‚Äì Present in some cases)
How it worked: Magnetic coating on plastic tape stores data in serial order.

Devices: Tape drives, cassette tapes, reel-to-reel.

Capacity: Started with a few KB, now goes up to terabytes.

Speed: Slow for random access, okay for sequential access.

Durability: Good if stored properly.

Use case: Backups, archiving.

3. Magnetic Drum (1950s‚Äì60s)
How it worked: Rotating drum with magnetic coating, read/write heads over fixed tracks.

Capacity: A few KB to MB.

Speed: Faster than tape, slower than modern drives.

Durability: Mechanically complex, not widely adopted.

Use case: Main memory in early computers.

4. Floppy Disks (1970s‚Äì2000s)
How it worked: Thin magnetic disk in a plastic shell.

Sizes: 8-inch, 5.25-inch, 3.5-inch.

Capacity: Ranged from 80 KB to 1.44 MB.

Speed: Low, but random access possible.

Durability: OK, but magnetic fields or bending could damage.

Use case: Software distribution, file transfer.

5. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) (1956‚ÄìPresent)
How it works: Spinning magnetic platters with read/write heads.

Capacity: GB to multiple TB.

Speed: Moderate (5400‚Äì7200 RPM common; 100 MB/s+).

Durability: Prone to damage due to moving parts.

Use case: Primary storage in PCs, servers, etc.

6. Optical Discs (1980s‚ÄìPresent)
Types: CD (700MB), DVD (4.7GB), Blu-ray (25GB+).

How it worked: Laser reads/writes data encoded as pits/lands on disc.

Durability: Good if scratch-free.

Use case: Media, software, backups.

7. Flash Storage / Solid-State Drives (1990s‚ÄìPresent)
Types: SSDs, USB flash drives, SD cards.

How it works: NAND flash memory stores data electronically.

Speed: Very fast (up to GB/s).

Capacity: Ranges from GB to several TB.

Durability: Excellent (no moving parts).

Use case: Laptops, phones, servers, gaming.

8. Cloud Storage (2000s‚ÄìPresent)
How it works: Data stored on remote servers accessed via the internet.

Examples: Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive.

Capacity: Virtually unlimited.

Speed: Depends on internet connection.

Durability: High (redundant backups).

Use case: Syncing files, collaboration, remote access.

9. Modern Emerging Storage (Future/Now)
Examples:

DNA Storage: Data encoded in synthetic DNA.

Holographic Storage: 3D data stored in crystal using light.

Quantum Storage: Based on quantum mechanics.

Use case: Research phase, not mainstream yet.
