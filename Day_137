Option meanings (commonly 1-letter options):
N (Keep your current version)

Safe choice if you made changes you care about.

Keeps your current file, avoids overwriting.

Recommended if you customized LightDM (like auto-login, greeter settings, etc.).

Y (Use the maintainer's version)

Replaces your file with the default from the package.

Use if you haven’t customized the file, or want a clean, updated default.

D (Show differences)

Shows a diff between your version and the new one.

Useful for deciding whether to keep yours or take the new one.

Z (Shell prompt)

Opens a shell so you can manually inspect, back up, or compare files.

✅ What you should do:
If you haven’t manually edited /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf yourself, you can safely choose "Y" (use the package maintainer's version).

If you have customized it (e.g., set auto-login or theme), choose "D" to compare or "N" to keep your settings.

If unsure, choose "N" (keep your current version), and review or merge changes later manually.
