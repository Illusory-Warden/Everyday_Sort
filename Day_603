**Perfect! 🎉 Your monitoring dashboard is working correctly!**

You can see:
- ✅ **CPU usage:** 54.2% busy
- ✅ **RAM usage:** 54.6% used (3 GiB total)
- ✅ **System Load:** 162% (high - shown in red)
- ✅ **Disk usage:** Root FS at 17.6%
- ✅ **Uptime:** 58.4 minutes
- ✅ **CPU and Memory graphs** showing historical data

## Regarding Auto-start on Server Reboot:

**Yes! ✅** All services are configured to start automatically when your server boots up:

1. **Grafana** - ✅ Enabled (you ran `systemctl enable grafana-server`)
2. **Prometheus** - ✅ Enabled (you ran `systemctl enable prometheus`)
3. **Node Exporter** - ✅ Enabled (you ran `systemctl enable node_exporter`)

So if your server shuts down or reboots, all three services will automatically start, and your monitoring will continue working without any manual intervention.

You can verify this anytime by running:
```bash
sudo systemctl is-enabled grafana-server prometheus node_exporter
```

**Your Ubuntu server monitoring setup is now complete!** 🎊
