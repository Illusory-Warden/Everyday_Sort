### ðŸ“Œ Mintzbergâ€™s 10 Schools of Strategy (Detailed Bullet Points)

1. **Cognitive School** â€“ *Strategy as a mental process*

   * Focus: How managers **perceive, interpret, and process information**.
   * Strategy comes from **mental models, concepts, and frameworks** already in peopleâ€™s minds.
   * Weakness: Risk of bias, misinterpretation, or limited perspectives.

2. **Design School** â€“ *Strategy as a fit*

   * Strategy = achieving a **match between internal strengths/weaknesses** and **external opportunities/threats**.
   * Uses **SWOT analysis** as a key tool.
   * Emphasizes clear vision and mission to guide the fit.
   * Weakness: Can be too static â€” assumes stable environments.

3. **Entrepreneurial School** â€“ *Strategy as vision*

   * Driven by the **visionary leader** (often founder or CEO).
   * Strategy = bold vision of the future + risk-taking.
   * Leader motivates and inspires employees to follow the vision.
   * Works well in startups or fast-moving environments.
   * Weakness: Too dependent on one leader â†’ risky if vision is flawed.

4. **Cultural School** â€“ *Strategy as a collective process*

   * Strategy is shaped by **shared values, norms, and beliefs** in the organization.
   * Culture acts as the glue that aligns peopleâ€™s actions with the strategy.
   * Useful for long-term stability and consistency.
   * Weakness: Can resist change â†’ culture may block innovation.

5. **Positioning School** â€“ *Strategy as analytical positioning*

   * Popularized by **Michael Porterâ€™s models** (e.g., Five Forces, generic strategies).
   * Focus: Analytical, data-driven choice of the **best position** in the market/industry.
   * Emphasizes competition, cost leadership, differentiation, or niche focus.
   * Weakness: Can be overly numbers-driven, ignoring softer factors like people and culture.

6. **Planning School** â€“ *Strategy as formal process*

   * Strategy created through **formal, step-by-step planning** procedures.
   * Involves multiple levels of decision-making (corporate, business, functional).
   * Relies heavily on forecasts, budgets, and systematic analysis.
   * Weakness: Can be rigid and bureaucratic; assumes future is predictable.

7. **Power School** â€“ *Strategy as politics and power*

   * Strategy shaped by **power struggles and negotiations**.
   * Two perspectives:

     * **Internal politics** â†’ coalitions, influence within the company.
     * **External power** â†’ using bargaining power over suppliers, customers, or competitors.
   * Weakness: Can lead to conflict, inefficiency, and self-interest overriding organizational goals.

8. **Learning School** â€“ *Strategy as an emerging process*

   * Strategy evolves through **learning, experimentation, and adaptation**.
   * Focus on building **competencies and capabilities** over time.
   * Strategy is flexible, not fixed â†’ managers adapt as they learn.
   * Works well in dynamic, uncertain environments.
   * Weakness: Can lack direction if learning is too slow or unfocused.

9. **Environmental School** â€“ *Strategy as a response to the environment*

   * Strategy shaped mainly by **external forces** (market trends, regulations, technology, competition).
   * Organizations are seen as **reactive** â€” they adapt to survive.
   * Emphasizes understanding **life cycles, demand, and supply conditions**.
   * Weakness: Very reactive â†’ gives little room for proactive leadership.

10. **Configuration School** â€“ *Strategy as transformation*

* Organizations go through **different life stages** (startup, growth, maturity, decline, renewal).
* Each stage requires a different strategy.
* Strategy often happens during **transformational change** (e.g., restructuring, mergers, turnarounds).
* Weakness: Hard to predict when/where transformation will occur.
