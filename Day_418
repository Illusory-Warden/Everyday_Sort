### ❌ Vande Bharat status

* There is **no evidence** in railway data or schedules that a Vande Bharat Express is plying between Nagpur and Tirupati.
* Also, because Vande Bharat rakes are generally chair car / day-train type for shorter distances, this long route (~1000-1300 km, many hours overnight) isn’t typical for existing Vande Bharat operations.
* One relevant note: there is a *Secunderabad ↔ Tirupati Vande Bharat* train. ([mint][2]) But that doesn’t serve Nagpur.
