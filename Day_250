Got it — Parrot OS is Debian-based, so you can install the Twingate client using the **Debian/Ubuntu repository method**.

Here’s what you should run:

---

### **1. Add Twingate’s GPG key**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.twingate.com/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/twingate-client-keyring.gpg
```

---

### **2. Add the Twingate repository**

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/twingate-client-keyring.gpg] https://packages.twingate.com/apt/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/twingate.list
```

---

### **3. Update package list**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

### **4. Install the Twingate client**

```bash
sudo apt install twingate
```

*(If you want the latest beta version, use `twingate-latest` instead.)*

---

### **5. Run setup**

```bash
sudo twingate setup
```

* This will ask for your **Twingate network name** (provided by your Twingate admin or account).
* You’ll authenticate in a browser window.

---

### **6. Start Twingate**

```bash
sudo twingate start
```

Check status:

```bash
twingate status
```

Stop:

```bash
sudo twingate stop
```
