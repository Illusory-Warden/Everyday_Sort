## **📌 Formula for the nᵗʰ Term of an Arithmetic Sequence**

If:

* **a** = first term
* **d** = common difference
* **n** = term number

Then the **nᵗʰ term** (**Tₙ**) is:

[
T_n = a + (n - 1)d
]

---

## **🔍 Explanation**

* The first term is **a**.
* Each time you move to the next term, you add **d**.
* After (n – 1) steps, you’ve added (n – 1)d.

---

## **✨ Example**

**Sequence:** 5, 9, 13, 17, ...

Here:

* ( a = 5 )
* ( d = 4 )

Find the **7th term**:

[
T_7 = 5 + (7 - 1) \cdot 4 = 5 + 24 = 29
]
