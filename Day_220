Here are the answers to the questions from your images:

1. **Which of the following is/are not a thing as per IoT?**  
   **d. None of these**  
   (All listed—fan, light, refrigerator—can be IoT "things.")

2. **The things in IoT consist of embedded systems.**  
   **a. True**  
   (IoT devices typically have embedded systems.)

3. **IoT is one of the technologies that enable smart farms.**  
   **a. True**  
   (IoT enables precision agriculture and smart farms.)

4. **In M2M, it is mandatory that the interactions between the machines and devices happen through a cloud computing infrastructure.**  
   **b. False**  
   (M2M can also use direct and local communication—cloud is not mandatory.)

5. **Sometimes, when there is a need for the nodes to communicate directly to the Internet, ______ can be used.**  
   **c. Tunneling**  
   (Tunneling allows communication through private/public networks to the Internet.)

6. **In multi-homing a node/network is connected to only two networks for improved reliability.**  
   **b. False**  
   (Multi-homing can involve connection to two or more networks, not just two.)

7. **Which of the following is/are not enablers of IoT?**  
   **a. Advancement in gene sequencing**  
   (Gene sequencing is not related to IoT.)

8. **The decreasing number of devices in IoT is expected to result in an address crunch.**  
   **b. False**  
   (It’s the increasing number—decreasing would alleviate address issues.)

9. **Why has IoT become so popular?**  
   **d. All of these**  
   (All statements are correct regarding IoT's popularity.)

10. **The resolution of a sensor is the maximum change it can detect in the quantity that it is measuring.**  
    **b. True**  
    (This is the correct definition of sensor resolution.)

11. **Transducer is a ________ term and includes _________.**  
    **c. Collective, both sensors and actuators**  
    (Transducer refers collectively to sensors and actuators.)

12. **Which of the following is/are feature/features of sensors?**  
    **c. Both (a) and (b)**  
    (Sensors are sensitive to the measured property AND interact with their environment.)
