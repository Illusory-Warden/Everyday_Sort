## AIM-45A Sentinel Missile `.ork` Files (by K’Tesh)

**Source:** Rocketry Forum – K’Tesh's “OpenRocket Files” thread, Page 6 ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][1]).

**Available Variants (.ork files):**

* **Stock (Decaled)** – A version faithful to the original Estes kit with decals.
* **E-Powered Clone** – Modified to use an Estes “E” motor.
* **D-to-E Two-Stage with Payload** – A two-stage version modified from D to E motors, includes a payload compartment.
* **E-to-E Two-Stage Payload Version** – Two-stage design using E motors in both stages, with payload.

You can download these `.ork` files directly from the thread attachments. Each version weighs between **56–66 KB**, depending on variant ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][1]).

## AGM-78 Standard ARM `.ork` File (by mtnmanak)

**Source:** Rocketry Forum – “Wildman AGM-78 ARM Thread” ([Wikipedia][2], [National Museum of the U.S. Air Force][3]).

While the forum thread isn't fully searchable here, it includes a post by **mtnmanak** offering an OpenRocket version:

> “Based on WM’s listed specs and some clues within the RockSim file, I created an OpenRocket version… if anyone is interested in it, here it is.” ([Wikipedia][2]).

This suggests there's at least one `.ork` file attachment available in that thread, likely representing the AGM-78 geometry and specifications in the simulator.

## Summary of `.ork` File Details

| Rocket Model            | Available Variants / Notes                                             | File Size (approx.)                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AIM-45A Sentinel**    | Stock decaled, E-powered, D→E two-stage payload, E→E two-stage payload | 56–66 KB each ([Rocketry Forum - Model Rocketry Forums][1]) |
| **AGM-78 Standard ARM** | One OpenRocket model (converted from RockSim, by mtnmanak)             | Likely similar (~50–100 KB)                                 |

1. **Visit the Rocketry Forum threads**:

   * Go to K’Tesh’s thread on Page 6 to download the specific AIM-45A `.ork` versions.
   * Go to the “Wildman AGM-78 ARM Thread” to download the AGM-78 model created by mtnmanak.

2. **Inspect `/ork` file contents** once downloaded:

   * Open them in **OpenRocket** to explore component dimensions, mass settings, motor configurations, staging, and payload setups.
   * Toggle `Appearance → Surface finish = None` and remove decals to evaluate the "naked" simulated geometry.

3. **Edit or tweak**:

   * These `.ork` files make excellent starting points for customization—adjust nosecone shape, fin dimensions, body length, or motor types as desired.
