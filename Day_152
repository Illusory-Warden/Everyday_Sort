Got it — if you ran:

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

and got something like:

```

## 🔧 Install Docker Engine (Step 4 Recap)

Run these commands **in order**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

> If you get errors here, it likely means the Docker repo (Step 3) wasn’t set up correctly — let me know if that happens and I’ll guide you through it.

### ✅ Then try:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

You should now see Docker running ✅.

### 🔍 Quick Sanity Test
