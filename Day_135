The **O2 tablet** is a combination antibiotic containing **ofloxacin (200 mg)** and **ornidazole (500 mg)**. It's commonly used in India to treat **mixed bacterial and protozoal gastrointestinal infections**, such as dysentery or traveler's diarrhea ([truemeds.in][1]).

### 🩺 Uses & How It Works

* **Treats** diarrhea caused by bacteria or protozoa (like amoebiasis, giardiasis) ([nationalpharmacy.in][2]).
* Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA replication and ornidazole targets anaerobic bacteria and parasites ([healthpluscity.com][3]).
* Fast-acting: often starts giving relief within 1–3 hours ([practo.com][4]).

### ⚠️ Side Effects & Precautions

* **Common**: nausea, stomach pain, dizziness, headache, insomnia, metallic taste .
* **Serious** (rare): tendon damage, heart rhythm changes, allergic skin reactions ([pharmbaba.com][5]).
* **Avoid alcohol**—can cause severe reactions with ornidazole ([healthpluscity.com][3]).
* **Use cautiously** with kidney or liver issues, heart conditions, or in pregnancy & breastfeeding ([nationalpharmacy.in][2]).
* **Not for children** under 18 ([pharmeasy.in][6]).

### ✅ When to Take It

You described:

* Recurrent stomach pain after meals, followed by loose stools.

This could be due to a **bacterial or protozoal infection**, but may also be from viral causes or IBS.
**O2 tablet is appropriate only if**:

* You have signs of infection (fever, mucus/blood in stool, prolonged or worsening symptoms).
* A doctor confirms a bacterial or protozoal cause—often via stool test.

**Important**: Do **not self‑medicate** with O2 tablet unless medically advised. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistance or side effects.

### 🔎 What You Should Do Instead

1. **Stool test** at a clinic to identify the cause.
2. If positive for pathogens, a doctor may prescribe O2 tablet.
3. Meanwhile:

   * Stick to **hydration** and bland foods.
   * Take **probiotics** (e.g., *Sporolac*, *Darolac*).
   * Use **antispasmodics** (like *meftal-spas*/cyclopam) for cramps only if prescribed.
4. **Follow prescription** carefully, complete the full course, and **avoid alcohol** while taking it.
