That’s totally possible ✅ and in fact some projects already do this (like **SpiderFoot**, **Maltego**, or **OSINT Framework**).

## 🏗️ How You Could Build a Web-based OSINT Toolkit

### 1. **Frontend (UI)**

* A dashboard where the user selects the type of investigation:

  * 🔎 Search by **username**
  * 🌐 Search by **domain/IP**
  * 📧 Search by **email/phone**
  * 🚗 Search by **vehicle number** (via paid API)
  * 📸 Reverse image lookup (via Google, Yandex, TinEye API)

* The UI could have **modules/widgets** for each tool.

* Built with React, Angular, or Vue for a smooth experience.

---

### 2. **Backend**

* Each tool can be wrapped as an API.

* Example modules you can plug in:

  * **Username check** → Run Sherlock or WhatsMyName.
  * **Domain info** → WHOIS, DNSDumpster, Shodan API.
  * **Email check** → HaveIBeenPwned, EmailRep.io.
  * **Social media scraper** → Twint (Twitter), InstaLooter (Instagram, if public).
  * **Vehicle info** → Private APIs like Masters India / RapidAPI.
  * **Image OSINT** → InVID, Exiftool.

* Use **Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django)** or **Node.js (Express)** to tie these tools together.

---

### 3. **Architecture**

* **Web Server**: Hosts the UI (React/Vue).
* **API Layer**: Handles requests, calls tools/APIs, processes responses.
* **Database (optional)**: To cache results so you don’t re-run expensive lookups.
* **Job Queue**: For long-running scans (e.g., full username scan across 200 sites).

---

### 4. **Deployment**

* Host on a VPS/cloud (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).
* Use Docker to containerize tools (Sherlock, SpiderFoot, etc.).
* Offer it as a **private toolkit** (your own use/team use) or a **public portal**.

## 🌐 Existing Examples (for Inspiration)

* **SpiderFoot HX** – fully web-based OSINT automation tool.
* **Maltego** – graph-based visualization for entities.
* **Recon-ng** (with web frontends) – modular reconnaissance framework.
* **OSINT Framework** – just a web directory, but shows how to group tools.
