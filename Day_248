Yes, you technically can run **Kali Linux** on a phone as the primary OS, but it’s not straightforward, and it’s not really the intended use case for either the phone or Kali.

Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Direct Installation vs. Chroot/VM**

* **Direct installation (primary OS)** means replacing your phone’s existing Android/iOS firmware with Kali Linux ARM.

  * This requires an **unlocked bootloader**, a compatible device (usually older Androids with good Linux kernel support), and a **custom recovery** (like TWRP).
  * You’d need the **Kali NetHunter** or ARM image for your device.
  * Risk: Very high chance of *bricking* your device if the kernel and drivers aren’t perfectly matched.
  * Issues: Many phone hardware features (camera, modem, sensors) may not work well or at all.

* **Chroot / VM method (most common)** uses apps like **UserLAnd** or Termux + proot to run Kali inside Android, without replacing Android itself.

  * This is much safer and keeps full phone functionality.
  * Downsides: Slight performance loss, not a true "primary OS."

### 2. **Why it’s tricky as a primary OS**

* **Drivers**: Kali’s ARM builds aren’t tuned for every phone’s hardware.
* **No phone calling/SMS**: Modem support in mainline Linux is poor for most consumer smartphones.
* **Touchscreen issues**: You might need custom patches.
* **Updates**: No OTA updates like Android/iOS — you’d need to flash manually.

### 3. **Best realistic approach**

If your goal is **penetration testing on a phone**, use **Kali NetHunter** (which is Kali Linux adapted for Android) rather than fully replacing the OS.
NetHunter can:

* Run full Kali tools.
* Keep your Android’s phone features.
* Use special hardware (OTG WiFi adapters, HID attacks, etc.).
