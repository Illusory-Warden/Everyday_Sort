The problems where you:

* Take a function like $2n+5$, $5n^2$, etc.
* Try to **find upper bound (O)**, **lower bound (Î©)**, and **tight bound (Î˜)**
* Prove them with constants $c_1, c_2, n_0$ or using the limit method

are called **Asymptotic Analysis problems** (or sometimes just **Complexity Analysis problems**).

### ðŸ“˜ In textbooks / exams youâ€™ll see them named as:

* **Asymptotic Analysis**
* **Asymptotic Notation problems**
* **Big-O, Big-Î©, Big-Î˜ analysis**
* **Growth rate comparison**
* **Order of growth analysis**
