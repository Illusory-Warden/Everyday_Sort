## ✅ Step-by-Step: How to Run `rehash_passwords.php`

---

### 🧩 1. **Make Sure It’s in the Right Place**

Place your file inside the project directory that is being served by your local web server (like XAMPP):

**Example Path:**

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/Login_App_V2/rehash_passwords.php
```

Also confirm you have:

* ✅ A `db.php` file with correct DB credentials
* ✅ A `students` table in the `CSBS_DATA` database with `Student_UID` and `password` columns

---

### ▶️ 2. **Start Apache and MySQL (XAMPP)**

1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
2. Click **Start** on:

   * **Apache** (web server)
   * **MySQL** (database)

---

### 🌐 3. **Run the Script in Browser**

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost/Login_App_V2/rehash_passwords.php
```

If everything is correct, you’ll see:

```
✅ All passwords rehashed successfully!
```

And it will create a file named `rehash_log.txt` in the same folder (if logging is enabled).

---

### 🔎 4. **Verify It Worked (Optional)**

Check using **phpMyAdmin**:

1. Open: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Select your `CSBS_DATA` database
3. Open the `students` table
4. You should see new hashed passwords in the `password` column (they'll look like `$2y$10$...`)

---

### 🧹 5. **Clean Up**

Once done:

* ✅ **Delete or rename** `rehash_passwords.php`
* ✅ **Delete** `rehash_log.txt` if it contains plain passwords
* ✅ Optionally log this operation elsewhere for future tracking
