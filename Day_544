### ✅ The problem (clear & simple)

Your **`yt_download.py` file is still the OLD version**
(the one that checks **system PATH** instead of your local `ffmpeg/bin`)

That’s why it keeps saying:

```
❌ FFmpeg not found.
Install FFmpeg and add it to PATH
```

But you **already have FFmpeg locally**, which is ✅ correct.

---

## ✅ FIX (do this exactly — 2 minutes)

### 🔹 Step 1: Open `yt_download.py`

In VS Code:

* Click `yt_download.py`

---

### 🔹 Step 2: DELETE EVERYTHING inside it

Yes — select all → delete.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Paste THIS EXACT CODE
 Meow Meow Code
### 🔹 Step 4: SAVE the file

Press:

```
Ctrl + S
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Run again

In the terminal:

```powershell
python yt_download.py
```

Paste:

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULT (THIS TIME)

* ✅ No “FFmpeg not found”
* ✅ Video downloads
* ✅ Proper `.mp4`
* ✅ Plays in Windows Media Player

Saved in:

```
/downloads
```

---

## ✅ Why this happened (so it makes sense)

* Earlier script → checked **PATH**
* New setup → uses **local FFmpeg**
* File wasn’t updated → mismatch

This is a **very common dev mistake**, even for seniors — you handled it perfectly by stopping and checking 👍
