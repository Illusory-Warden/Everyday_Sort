### What’s going on (plain English)

SSH remembers the **identity (host key)** of every server you connect to.
That machine at `192.168.100.100` now presents a *different* key than last time, so SSH freaks out to protect you from a possible **man-in-the-middle attack**.

Most common harmless reasons:

* The server was **reinstalled**
* SSH keys were **regenerated**
* The IP now points to a **different machine**
* You rolled back / cloned a VM snapshot

---

## If you *expect* this change (very likely in a local network)

You just need to remove the old key.

### ✅ Fix (Windows – safest & easiest)

Run this in **Command Prompt or PowerShell**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.100.100
```

You should see something like:

```
# Host 192.168.100.100 found: line 8
# Host removed.
```

Now reconnect:

```bash
ssh warden@192.168.100.100
```

Type **yes** when asked to trust the new key.

---

## Manual fix (if you want to see the file)

1. Open the file:

```
C:\Users\rushi\.ssh\known_hosts
```

2. Delete **line 8** (it literally tells you that):

```
Offending ECDSA key in ...known_hosts:8
```

3. Save → reconnect via SSH

---

## ⚠️ When should you *NOT* blindly fix it?

Stop and verify if:

* This is a **production server**
* You’re on an **untrusted network**
* You didn’t expect *any* change

In that case, confirm the fingerprint:

```
SHA256:SswYFysYBt4fOcasH6nPfKwzP7WpQ+eG5iomxpi1low
```

with the server admin or by logging in locally.

---

## TL;DR

For local / lab / VM setups:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.100.100
ssh warden@192.168.100.100
```
