### Step 1: Given statements

1. ( a = b )
2. ( b = c )

---

### Step 2: Deduction

From those two, we can **logically conclude**:
[
a = c
]

---

### Step 3: Expressing it as a logical formula

We can write the whole rule like this:

[
[(a = b) \land (b = c)] \rightarrow (a = c)
]

---

### ✅ Explanation

* ( \land ) means “and.”
* ( \rightarrow ) means “implies.”
  So the formula reads:

> “If ( a = b ) and ( b = c ), then ( a = c ).”
