When we prove **tight bound (Î˜)**, weâ€™re comparing the function $f(n)$ to a *simpler growth function* $g(n)$ (usually the **dominant term**).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Pick the comparison function

For $f(n)=2n+5$, the dominant term is **$n$**, so we test against $g(n)=n$.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Sandwich $f(n)$ between two multiples of $g(n)$

We want constants $c_1, c_2$ such that:

$$
c_1 g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2 g(n)
$$

That is:

$$
c_1 n \le 2n+5 \le c_2 n
$$

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Pick constants near the coefficient of $n$ (here coefficient = 2)

* For the **lower bound**: choose $c_1 = 2$ (since $2n+5 \ge 2n$ always for $n \ge 1$).
* For the **upper bound**: pick a constant slightly **larger** than 2, say $c_2=3$. Then for $n \ge 5$,

  $$
  2n+5 \le 3n
  $$

So, weâ€™ve bounded it:

$$
2n \le 2n+5 \le 3n
$$

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Conclude

This means:

$$
2n+5 \in \Theta(n)
$$

---

âœ… So yes â€” we **pick constants around the dominant coefficient** of the leading term, and then check from which $n_0$ onwards the inequalities hold.
