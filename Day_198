## âœ… Here's How to Run `rehash_passwords.php` from Your Desktop Folder

You have **two options** â€” choose the one that fits your setup:

---

### âœ… **Option 1: Move Project to Apache's Root Folder (Recommended)**

If you're on **Linux (Debian)**:

1. **Move your project from Desktop to Apache's web root**:

```bash
sudo mv ~/Desktop/Login_App_V2 /var/www/html/
```

2. Now go to:

```
http://localhost/Login_App_V2/rehash_passwords.php
```

âœ… Done! This is the easiest and cleanest way to make it work.

### âœ… **Option 2: Tell Apache to Serve from Desktop Folder** (Not recommended for long-term)

If you **really want to serve directly from Desktop**, you'd need to:

#### Step 1: Edit Apache config

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

Change:

```apache
DocumentRoot /var/www/html
```

To:

```apache
DocumentRoot /home/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop/Login_App_V2
```

> Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your Linux username.

#### Step 2: Restart Apache

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Then go to:

```
http://localhost/rehash_passwords.php
```

## ðŸ§  Best Practice

Use Option 1 (move to `/var/www/html/`) so you donâ€™t mess with Apache settings, especially if you're new to server setup.

---

## Final Folder Check

After the move, your structure should look like this:

```
/var/www/html/Login_App_V2/
â”œâ”€â”€ rehash_passwords.php
â”œâ”€â”€ db.php
â”œâ”€â”€ login.php
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Now access in browser:

```
http://localhost/Login_App_V2/rehash_passwords.php
