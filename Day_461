## üíª **Assignment 2 vs DAA Innovative Method 2**

**Instruction File:** *DAA Innovative Method 2.pdf*
**Student File:** *Assignment_2.pdf*

### ‚úÖ Matching Requirements:

| Component                      | Present | Remarks                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pseudocode / Source Code**   | ‚úîÔ∏è      | Well-written pseudocode (Bron‚ÄìKerbosch with pivot) + full Java code.             |
| **Dry Run / Trace Table**      | ‚úîÔ∏è      | Step-by-step trace table with example graph (A‚ÄìE) and intermediate sets.         |
| **Flowchart / Visualization**  | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ASCII flowchart structure included ‚Äî meets the visualization requirement.        |
| **Code Explanation**           | ‚úîÔ∏è      | Explains functions, recursion, and stopping conditions thoroughly.               |
| **Complexity & Problem Class** | ‚úîÔ∏è      | Time and space complexity correctly stated; mentions NP-complete classification. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing / Improvement Points:

* **Video Demonstration:** The instruction mentions a *1‚Äì2 minute video explanation* with voice and code execution ‚Äî not referenced in the PDF.
* **Flowchart Format:** While an ASCII flowchart is acceptable, a **visual diagram (draw.io / Canva / PowerPoint)** would align more closely with the ‚Äúvisualization‚Äù part of the Innovative Method.

**‚úÖ Verdict:** **Almost perfect.** All technical and documentation requirements met; only the **video** component and **neat visual flowchart** are missing.
