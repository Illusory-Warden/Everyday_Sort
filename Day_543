```cpp
while (low < high)
```

### ✅ **What the condition *should* be**

For a correct binary search, the loop must continue **as long as `low <= high`**, not `<`.

### ❌ Your condition

Stops the loop too early and fails to check the final possible element.

### ✔ Correct condition

```cpp
while (low <= high)
```

---

### 🔍 **Why this is an error**

Binary search works by reducing the range `[low, high]`.
If you use `low < high`, the search stops *before checking the last remaining index*, which may contain the key.

Example:
If `low = high = 4`, the condition `low < high` becomes `4 < 4` → **false**,
so the loop exits **without checking index 4**.

---

### Minor issues (not errors but good to fix)

* `mid = (low + high) / 2;` should ideally be

  ```cpp
  mid = low + (high - low) / 2;   // avoids overflow
  ```

---

### ✔ Corrected loop part

```cpp
while (low <= high) {
    mid = (low + high) / 2;

    if (arr[mid] == key) {
        found = mid;
        break;
    }
    else if (arr[mid] < key) {
        low = mid + 1;
    }
    else {
        high = mid - 1;
    }
}
```
